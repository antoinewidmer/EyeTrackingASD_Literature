**NUANCE: Neurodevelopmental Understanding and Advanced Neurocognitive Classification for Enhanced Detection**


## Problem to solve
Difficulties to precisely diagnose ASD in different populations

Evolving conceptualisation of autism [[stewart2024]]:
 1.  from a ‘narrow’ definition to a ‘wide’ diagnostic criteria; 
 2. from a rare to a relatively common condition, although probably still under-recognised in women and older people; 
 3. a condition diagnosed predominately in males to now being identified in people of all genders; 
 4. from something affecting children, to a lifelong condition; 
 5. from something discrete and distinct, to a dimensional view; 
 6. from one thing to many ‘Autisms’, and a compound or fractionable condition; 
 7. from a focus on ‘pure’ Autism, to recognition that complexity and comorbidity is the norm; and finally, 
 8. from conceptualising Autism purely as a developmental disorder, to recognising a neurodiversity perspective, operationalised in participatory research models.

## current state-of-art

Literature is full of studies on the detection of ASD with various techniques
EEG
Biomarkers
- eye tracking
- body tracking

current state-of-art approaches use
- fixed images with and without faces
- small movies with human interactions and object in the background

### Suggested Improvements

|Area of Improvement|Description|
|---|---|
|**Reliability & Consistency**|Digital tools must produce stable results within short periods for individual children.|
|**Diverse Population Validation**|Studies should ensure effectiveness across race, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds.|
|**Reducing False Positives**|High rates of false positives (especially in younger children) must be minimized to prevent overdiagnosis.|
|**Clinical Interpretability**|Physicians need clear guidance on interpreting and communicating digital phenotyping results.|
|**Integration with Existing Screening**|Combining SensetoKnow with M-CHAT or other validated tools can improve diagnostic accuracy.|
|**Understanding Developmental Delays**|Further research should distinguish between ASD-specific markers and general developmental delays.|
|**Implementation Studies**|Studies on how primary care providers use and act upon digital screening results are essential.|
