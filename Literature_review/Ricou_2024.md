## üìå Summary


## üî¨ Methods 
### Participants

- **Total Sample:** 259 participants
    
    - **ASD group:** 109 individuals (3-34 years old, mean 13.03 ¬± 7.90 years)
    - **TD (neurotypical) group:** 150 individuals (3-32 years old, mean 13.05 ¬± 7.39 years)
- **Age groups:**
    
    - **3-7 years old**
    - **8-12 years old**
    - **13-18 years old**
    - **19-33 years old**
- **Clinical assessments used for ASD diagnosis:**
    
    - **Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)**
    - **Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)**
    - **Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)**
    - **Developmental Quotient (DQ)**

### Tasks for participants

**Stimulus Presentation:**
    - **Static and dynamic stimuli** along a **gradient of social saliency**:
        - **Static objects**
        - **Static neutral faces**
        - **Dynamic neutral faces**
        - **Dynamic emotional faces** (happiness & sadness)
    - **Each stimulus lasted 4s, with a 2s interstimulus period.**
    - **Luminance and color matched** across stimuli.
    - **No explicit task** was given; participants were simply asked to watch the screen.
    
### System setup and hardware

- ### Data Analysis

#### Eye-Tracking & Pupillometry Data Exteraction

1. **Oculometric (Gaze) Parameters:**
    
    - **Proportion of time spent on faces, objects, and regions of interest (eyes, mouth, nose).**
    - **Fixation patterns & gaze trajectory.**
    - **Latency to first fixation on key face regions.**
2. **Pupillometric (Pupil Response) Parameters:**
    
    - **Baseline pupil size (before stimulus).**
    - **Event-Related Pupil Dilation (ERPD):** Pupil dilation in response to stimulus presentation.
    - **Measured over a fixed time window (2.25-4s) to assess physiological reactivity.**
- 
- ## üìä Results & Key Findings 


1. **ASD individuals exhibit invariant gaze and pupil responses to faces across development.**
    
    - **No maturation of face preference or pupil reactivity** seen in ASD.
    - **TD individuals show increased focus on eyes & reduced physiological reactivity with age.**
2. **Best ASD biomarkers are age-dependent:**
    
    - **Pupil dilation (ERPD) is a strong biomarker in young children (AUC ~0.95 for 3-7 years old).**
    - **Gaze behavior (fixation on eyes) becomes a better ASD discriminator in adolescents & adults.**
3. **Findings suggest ASD is characterized by atypical developmental trajectories in face processing.**
    
    - **Possible lack of social motivation or altered neurophysiological mechanisms (LC-NE system dysfunction).**
