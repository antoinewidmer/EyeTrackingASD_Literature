> With the development of global technology and teaching trends, digital technology teaching has become a common phenomenon today. This study uses the virtual reality social skills course to teach ten autistic students for Elementary and Junior High School, with the theme of “One Art Tour with Students” and four key points in the 12-year National Basic Education Curriculum. In virtual reality situational teaching, through t test analysis, it is found that inappropriate social behavior is obviously improved, and environmental adaptability is also greatly improved. Through interviews, parents and teachers believe that children’s social skills have improved. In addition, the research found that some problems must be noticed in the actual teaching process, including (1) black picture in virtual reality; (2) students control the handle controller in the virtual reality; and (3) definition of virtual space. The situations mentioned above should be handled with caution, they may affect the effectiveness of students' learning and involve the safety of the teaching process. These findings are suitable for virtual reality teaching and operation of students with autism, so opinions are provided to the field scholars as a reference.
