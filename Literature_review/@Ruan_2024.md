## üìå Summary

- Investigate whether **micro-expressions** (brief, involuntary facial movements) can serve as **biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)**.
- Develop and test a **machine learning (ML) model** for detecting and classifying **ASD-specific micro-expressions**.
- Use **ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) video data** for model training and validation.

## üî¨ Methods 
### Participants

- **Two datasets**:
    - **Caltech ADOS video dataset**: **33 ASD individuals** (26 males, 7 females).
    - **West Virginia University (WVU) ADOS dataset**: **9 typically developing (TD) controls** (3 males, 6 females).
- **Mean age:**
    - **ASD group:** 24.32 ¬± 5.77 years
    - **TD group:** 23.6 ¬± 3.93 years
- **Clinical assessments used:**
    - **ADOS-2 Module 4** (structured diagnostic interview)
    - **Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-II (WASI-II)**

### Tasks for participants

#### Oculometric (Gaze) & Micro-Expression Tasks

|**Task**|**Purpose**|**Key Measures**|
|---|---|---|
|**Face-Tracking Task**|Detect and follow **gaze and facial expressions**.|Eye contact duration, facial movement patterns.|
|**Micro-Expression Spotting**|Identify **brief, involuntary expressions**.|Expression onset, apex, and offset times.|
|**Emotion Classification**|Assess **correct vs. incorrect** emotion recognition.|Facial expression response patterns.|


### System setup and hardware

- ### Data Analysis
- 
- - **Videos captured during ADOS-2 interviews**.
- **Preprocessing:**
    - Face cropping & resizing (128√ó128 pixels).
    - Data augmentation (flipping, brightness adjustments).
- **Micro-Expression Detection:**
    - **Shallow Optical Flow Three-stream CNN (SOFTNet)**: Spots micro-expressions from videos.
- **Feature Extraction:**
    - **Micron-BERT** (Deep Learning model) extracts facial movement features.
- **Classification Models:**
    - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
    - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
    - **ResNet (Deep Learning Model)**

- ## üìä Results & Key Findings 

### Can Micro-Expressions Differentiate ASD from TD?

- **ML models achieved high accuracy in ASD classification:**
    - **Best performance:** **97.32% accuracy (F1 = 0.97)**
    - **Top-performing scenarios:** **Work/School, Daily Living, Loneliness**
- **However, models often relied on non-facial features (e.g., background differences).**
- **Masking facial features did not significantly impact classification performance**, suggesting potential **dataset bias**.

### RSI Symptom Prediction (ADOS-2)

- **High performance for some social behaviors:**
    - **Unusual eye contact (83% accuracy)**
    - **Language-linked nonverbal communication (83% accuracy)**
    - **Social overtures (87% accuracy)**
- **Lower performance for other ADOS behaviors (e.g., responsibility, enjoyment in interaction).**

### Issues with Micro-Expression Reliability

- **Challenges:**
    - **Micro-expressions were difficult to detect due to low video resolution.**
    - **Some ASD individuals naturally had reduced facial expressions**, making micro-expression analysis less informative.
    - **Machine learning models relied on background features rather than facial movements.**

### Summary

1. **Micro-expressions alone are not reliable ASD biomarkers** due to:
    
    - **Video quality limitations.**
    - **Variability in ASD facial expressivity.**
    - **Machine learning models relying on background artifacts.**
2. **However, micro-expressions could still be useful when combined with other biomarkers** (e.g., gaze tracking, speech analysis).
    
3. **Future Research Directions:**
    
    - **Higher-resolution video recordings.**
    - **Multimodal AI combining micro-expressions with gaze/speech analysis.**
    - **Testing on larger, more diverse ASD populations.**
