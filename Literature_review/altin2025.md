> [!Abstract]
>
> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by limitations in social communication and interaction, self-repetitive behaviors, and the presence of limited interests. The prevalence of ASD, which typically emerges in the first years of life, is increasing at an alarming rate due to multiple factors, including the broadening of diagnostic criteria, heightened public awareness, and more frequent diagnoses among women and adults. Over the years, experts have invested considerable time and effort in developing educational scenarios for children with ASD. However, they have faced challenges replicating certain scenarios—such as emergencies, crowded public transportation, or restaurant environments—because recreating these exact conditions in real-world settings is difficult or cost-prohibitive. This has consequently compelled experts to seek out supplementary intervention methods that are more suitable and accessible. Virtual reality (VR), which has the capacity to integrate the physical and virtual realms, represents one such alternative intervention method. In this study, a systematic review of studies employing VR technology in social skills interventions for individuals with ASD was conducted, and 31 studies were included. The findings indicate the potential benefits of VR applications focusing on the social skills of individuals with ASD. Additionally, this research elucidates the limitations of the studies and offers suggestions for future research.
