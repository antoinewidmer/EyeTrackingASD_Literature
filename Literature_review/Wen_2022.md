## 📌 Summary

- **Objective:**
    
    - Validate **GeoPref Test**, an **eye-tracking-based biomarker** for early autism detection in toddlers.
    - **Test sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value** in a **large, diverse toddler sample (N = 1,863)**.
    - Investigate **genetic links** by analyzing **sibling and twin data**.
- **Key Significance:**
    
    - Autism diagnosis is **often delayed until ages 3-4**.
    - This study aims to create a **rapid, objective, and scalable screening tool**.

## 🔬 Methods 
### Participants

- **Total Participants:** **1,863 toddlers (12–48 months old)**
    
    - **ASD (N = 725)**
    - **ASD Features (N = 103)**
    - **Global Developmental Delay (N = 128)**
    - **Language Delay (N = 198)**
    - **Neurotypical (N = 487)**
    - **Typical Sibling of ASD Child (N = 60)**
    - **Other Delays (N = 162)**
- **Demographics:**
    
    - **Age range:** 12–48 months (Mean: 24.4 months)
    - **Gender:** 63% Male, 37% Female
    - **Ethnic Representation:** Diverse racial and ethnic groups included.

### Tasks for participants


#### **(A) Visual Stimuli**

- The child watched **two videos presented side-by-side**:
    
    - **Left Screen:** **Social stimulus** (children dancing, smiling, playing).
    - **Right Screen:** **Geometric stimulus** (moving shapes, spinning patterns).
- **The toddler was free to look anywhere** without instructions or rewards.
    

#### **(B) Data Recorded**

- **Fixation Duration:** % of time spent looking at **social vs. geometric stimuli**.
    
- **Fixation Thresholds:** Defined categories based on **% of time looking at geometric images**:
    
    - **≥69% geometric fixation** → **ASD-Geo (Autism with geometric preference)**
    - **≤31% geometric fixation** → **ASD-Soc (Autism with social preference)**
    - **32–68% geometric fixation** → **ASD-Mid (Mixed attention pattern)**
- **Saccade Rate:** Number of **shifts between images**.
    
    - **Fewer saccades** → Lower visual exploration.
    - **Higher saccades** → More dynamic gaze shifts.

### System setup and hardware
**Device Used:** **Tobii T120 (60 Hz)**

### Data Analysis

#### Eye-Tracking Metrics Used

|**Category**|**Metrics**|**Key Finding in ASD**|
|---|---|---|
|**Fixation-Based**|Fixation duration, thresholds, first fixation|ASD-Geo toddlers had a **strong geometric preference (≥69%)**.|
|**Saccade-Based**|Saccade count, saccade rate|**Fewer saccades in ASD**, indicating **reduced visual exploration**.|
|**Gaze Transition**|Alternation rate, dwell time|ASD-Geo toddlers had **lower gaze alternation and longer dwell times on geometric stimuli**.|
|**Blink Metrics**|Blink rate|ASD toddlers had **lower blink rates**, suggesting **hyper-focus**.|

✅ **Combining fixation, saccades, and gaze transitions improved ASD classification accuracy.**  
✅ **GeoPref Test showed a strong genetic link in visual attention patterns.**

- ## 📊 Results & Key Findings 


### **Autism Classification Accuracy**

|**Metric**|**GeoPref Test (69% Fixation Threshold)**|**GeoPref Test + Saccades**|
|---|---|---|
|**Specificity (True Negative Rate)**|**98%**|**95%**|
|**Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)**|**17%**|**33%**|
|**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**|**81%**|**84%**|
|**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**|**65%**|**71%**|

✅ **High specificity (low false positives, ~2%)**

- ## Related Work

- **Social attention deficits in ASD** have been widely studied with **eye-tracking**.
- **Prior GeoPref studies** (110 & 333 toddlers) showed **similar results** but lacked large-scale validation.
- **Previous research identified 85–100% PPV for GeoPref Test**, supporting its reliability.
- **Neuroimaging studies** link **geometric preference to reduced social-brain connectivity**.


## 📝 Observations

### Strengths of the Study

✅ **Largest ASD eye-tracking study to date** (1,863 toddlers).  
✅ **High specificity (98%)**, meaning **very few false positives**.  
✅ **Validated across diverse racial & ethnic groups**.  
✅ **Test–retest reliability up to 24 months**.  
✅ **Potential genetic marker for ASD** (twin/sibling correlations).  
✅ **Easy to implement** (non-invasive, short test duration).

### Major Concerns and Challenges

⚠️ **Low sensitivity (17%)** – Many ASD toddlers do not show geometric preference.  
⚠️ **Performance declines in older toddlers (>40 months)**.  
⚠️ **Does not replace a full clinical diagnosis**.  
⚠️ **Social vs. sensory preference unclear** – Are ASD toddlers drawn to geometric images due to **sensory processing differences**?  
⚠️ **Limited age range (12–48 months)** – Needs validation for **older children/adults**.

## 🚀 Future Directions

🔹 **Combine GeoPref Test with other biomarkers** (e.g., social gaze, facial expressions).  
🔹 **Investigate sensory processing differences** in ASDGeo toddlers.  
🔹 **Expand to home-based webcam eye-tracking for wider accessibility**.  
🔹 **Further genetic studies** to identify risk genes associated with geometric preference.  
🔹 **Develop interventions targeting ASDGeo subtype for personalized treatment**.
