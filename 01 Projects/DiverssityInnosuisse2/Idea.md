Scope of new Innosuisse: Based on the prototype we developed in the actual Innosuisse ( ending 31/03) we want to be able to  create new content with AI agents so to increase the difficulty of  our environments with verbal social interactions with our avatars. We want the AI agent to learn from the user so to adapt its reaction to the emotion state of the individual. In addition to that,  usually all what is developed in respect of AI agent is biased as trained on neurotypic reactions. Our will be developed so to interact comprehensively with neurodiverse/ASD user.
