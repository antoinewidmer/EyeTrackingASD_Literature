### üîπ **1. Aligning with BRIDGE Discovery Objectives**

- Your project should emphasize how **ET provides a clinically relevant and innovative solution** to a **persistent challenge in ASD/ADHD differentiation**.
- Clearly state that this research is **beyond basic science** and aims for **real-world impact** (avoiding it being categorized as purely fundamental research, which is outside BRIDGE‚Äôs scope).
- Highlight how **data-driven grouping and dimensional measures** offer an alternative to rigid diagnostic categories.
- Consider how the findings could **translate into a tool for clinical practice**, possibly integrating into existing screening workflows for pediatricians or psychologists.



### üîπ **2. Innovation Potential**

- Define a clear **unique selling proposition (USP)** for using **ET as a neurobehavioral biomarker** beyond current clinical frameworks.
- Compare with **existing diagnostic tools** to show how **your approach is superior, more objective, and applicable earlier** in life.
- Reference **previous ET research** to substantiate the potential of this method (e.g., differences in gaze fixation patterns, reduced disengagement from stimuli)‚ÄãEye Movements.
- **Address scalability**: Could the ET framework be **adapted** into **portable, affordable, and scalable solutions** for **widespread implementation**?



### üîπ **3. Scientific Objectives & Feasibility**

- **What you aim to achieve:** Identify specific **biomarkers of gaze behavior** that differentiate ASD, ADHD, and comorbid cases.
    
- **How you will do it:** Outline your methodology, including:
    
    - **ET metrics:** Fixation duration, first fixation, gaze alternation, pupil dilation, etc.‚ÄãEye Movements.
    - **Experimental Design:** Age group selection (preschool), stimuli design (social vs. non-social).
    - **Validation approach:** How you will ensure the findings are clinically relevant and reproducible.
- **Feasibility:** Ensure you present a **clear and achievable timeline**, including:
    
    - Data collection phase.
    - Feature extraction and analysis.
    - Validation using **machine learning or statistical models**.



### üîπ **4. Implementation Strategy & Impact**

- Provide a **roadmap** for **how your findings will transition from research to application**, ensuring **alignment with BRIDGE Discovery‚Äôs focus on research-to-innovation**‚Äã
- Detail a **collaboration plan** with relevant stakeholders (e.g., hospitals, pediatricians, AI/ET companies).
- Explain **how clinicians can adopt ET tools** into their diagnostic pipeline.
- Consider **ethical and regulatory factors**: How will your approach fit within **existing healthcare policies**?



### üîπ **5. Sustainable Development Contribution**

- **Societal Impact:** Early and accurate differentiation of ASD/ADHD could **reduce misdiagnoses**, leading to **timely and more effective interventions**.
- **Economic Impact:** Cost-effective and scalable ET-based tools could **decrease the burden on healthcare systems** by reducing **late-stage diagnoses and ineffective treatments**.
- **Environmental Considerations:** If any **hardware development** is involved, ensure it aligns with **sustainable practices**.



### üîπ **6. Addressing BRIDGE Discovery‚Äôs Competitive Nature**

- As per past testimonials‚Äã, BRIDGE Discovery is **extremely competitive**, and **inter-institutional collaboration is highly valued**.
- Ensure you demonstrate:
    - **Pre-existing industry/end-user connections** (e.g., hospitals, mental health clinics).
    - **A clear ‚Äúbeta testing‚Äù plan** to validate your findings **during** the project.
    - **Implementation feasibility without regulatory hurdles**, at least for initial applications.



### üîπ **7. Risk Mitigation Strategy**

- **Technical risks:** Eye-tracking variability across devices and age groups.
- **Clinical risks:** Ensuring **robust differentiation of ASD/ADHD** and generalizability across diverse populations.
- **Adoption barriers:** Address potential **reluctance from clinicians** to adopt ET-based assessments.



### üìå **Next Steps**

‚úÖ **Ensure compliance with BRIDGE Discovery requirements**‚Äã:

- **20-page max project description**
- Use **the provided template**
- Highlight **interdisciplinary collaboration** (e.g., AI, clinical psychology, neuroscience).
- Demonstrate **a clear innovation and implementation path**.

‚úÖ **Prepare for the two-stage evaluation**‚Äã:

- **First stage:** A strong written proposal is needed to progress to the interview.
- **Second stage:** Convince evaluators that the project is neither **too fundamental** nor **too applied** but **perfectly positioned for translation into real-world impact**.



This project holds **strong potential** for **real-world application in clinical settings**, and **BRIDGE Discovery is a great funding avenue**. Structuring the proposal effectively to meet **innovation, feasibility, and implementation goals** will enhance its competitiveness. Let me know if you need further **refinement of specific sections** or **help with drafting the proposal document!** üöÄ
