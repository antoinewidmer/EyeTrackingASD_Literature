the proposal for the SNSF bridge call for project is to develop a novel eye-tracking system with higher temporal and spatial resolution to allow a finer detection of neurodevelopmental disorders. the clinical use-case would be to differentiate ADHD from ASD before ADHD is clinically detected. the added value of the project would be to have an early detection of ADHD to set the appropriate medical care.

Our project aims to develop a novel eye-tracking system with enhanced temporal and spatial resolution to improve the detection of neurodevelopmental disorders. The clinical use-case focuses on differentiating ADHD from ASD before ADHD is clinically diagnosed. The key added value of our approach is enabling earlier detection of ADHD, allowing for timely and appropriate medical intervention.


the workplan of the project is as follows:
CSEM will develop the high temporal resolution eye-tracking system using a novel type of cameras. the first prototype will include a VR screen as it lowers the complexity of the development. 

CHUV will develop detection activities in VR that can lead to differentiate ASD from ADHD. At first we would like to involve an older children population (from 6 years old) that is already diagnosed (only ASD, ASD+ADHD, only ADHD, Typically developping). We will use the eye-tracking in these activities to identify eye tracking metrics that are different among the population.

HES-SO will develop machine learning algorithms for the eye-tracking system and code the activities in VR and help for the data collection and analysis.



Thank you for your interest in our project. I am pleased to provide further details regarding the proposed workplan and the distribution of responsibilities among the project partners:
- **CSEM** will develop the high-temporal-resolution eye-tracking system, based on a novel type of cameras. The initial prototype will be integrated into a VR headset to simplify the setup and ensure controlled visual stimuli.
- **CHUV** will design and validate VR-based activities that are tailored to distinguish between ASD and ADHD. In the first phase, we will work with children aged 6 and up, already diagnosed (ASD only, ADHD only, both, and typically developing), to collect ground truth data. Part of the data collection will focus on collecting neuroimaging (EEG) data, to test its potential in distinguishing the two conditions, and offering unique insights not available through the eye tracker.
- **HES-SO** will focus on developing machine learning algorithms to process the eye-tracking data, implement the VR activities, Part of the data collection will focus on collecting neuroimaging (EEG) data, to test its potential in distinguishing the two conditions, and offering unique insights not available through the eye tracker.

The goal is to identify distinctive eye-tracking patterns that can help differentiate ADHD from ASD, even before ADHD is clinically recognized.
