This project aims to develop an **AI-powered, eye-tracking (ET) based diagnostic tool** capable of differentiating **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and their comorbid presentations** in preschool children. By leveraging **gaze behavior and pupillary response biomarkers**, we seek to create an **objective, scalable, and non-invasive screening method** that can be used in **pediatric clinics, early education settings, and telehealth platforms**.
Our specific objectives are:

1. **Identify distinctive ET-based biomarkers** that differentiate ASD, ADHD, and comorbid cases using metrics such as **fixation duration, gaze alternation rates, and pupillary responses**.
2. **Develop an AI-driven classification model** that can analyze ET data and provide **real-time, automated diagnostic insights** for clinicians.
3. **Validate the tool through large-scale clinical trials** to establish **clinical reliability, sensitivity, and specificity** in distinguishing between ASD, ADHD, and typical development.
4. **Ensure integration into existing pediatric screening workflows**, allowing for **seamless adoption in healthcare and educational settings**.
