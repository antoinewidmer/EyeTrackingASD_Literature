- Validate findings through longitudinal tracking of developmental trajectories.
## 3.2 Methods & Practical Approach
> [!tip]- **what to write:**
>
> -Present your methods and the practical approach you adopt in order to reach your objectives and to tackle the challenges.

## 3.3 Validation Steps & Expected Results

> [!tip]- **what to write:**
>
> -For each line of research: · Describe the validation steps: how do you validate the applicability of your approach to achieve the planned innovation? · Describe the expected results and how they will be measured. If applicable, you may define yes/no criteria to assess the feasibility of your innovation at each key step.


## 3.4 Innovation Roadmap & Implementation Strategy

> [!tip]- **what to write:**
>
> · Present a roadmap that enables or facilitates the implementation of your planned scientific achievements. Please indicate the progress you expect in terms of maturity
> · Describe how you plan to bring your idea to market or to actors who will implement your results in an application, a service, a method, or a process. 
> · Discuss how you can reach end-users and how you could ensure that your solution is adopted. 
> · Describe your implementation strategy with respect to unique selling proposition (USP), (societal) value creation, competitive environment, existing market, market access, regulatory situation, scalability, intellectual property, etc. 
> · Discuss the main challenges you expect to face with regard to implementation strategy and partners.

## 3.5 Milestones

> [!tip]- **what to write:**
>
> ·Present a detailed project plan including work packages, milestones and deliverables. One of the work packages should concern implementation, e.g., by comprising either a business case or a clear plan for value creation and for reaching end-users. 
> Present your milestones and work packages in a structured way, e.g., with a table. 
> The presented measures must be feasible and realistic within the timeframe of the funding period.
