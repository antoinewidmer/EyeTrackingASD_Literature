Several patents exist in the domain of **eye-tracking for cognitive and neurological disorders**, particularly in areas related to **autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)**. Some notable patents include:

- **ET-based diagnostic tools for ASD detection:** Companies such as **Cognoa** and **Brain Power** have patented AI-driven ET algorithms designed to analyze **gaze fixation and social attention deficits** as ASD biomarkers.
- **Gaze-based cognitive assessment tools:** Patents exist for **using ET to evaluate executive function and attention control in ADHD**. For example, **Neural Analytics Inc.** has patents covering **pupillometry and saccade-based assessments for cognitive disorders**.
- **Wearable eye-tracking systems:** Companies like **Tobii** and **Pupil Labs** hold patents related to **hardware innovations** for ET, primarily in VR/AR and human-computer interaction, but their focus is not on clinical neurodevelopmental diagnostics.

Despite these advancements, **most existing patents focus on using ET for ASD or ADHD in isolation, rather than differentiating between comorbid presentations**. Furthermore, many commercially available ET solutions have **not been clinically validated for early childhood use**, and there is **no standardized ET-based screening protocol in pediatric diagnostics**. This leaves **a patentable space for our project**, particularly in **developing an AI-driven ET model that objectively distinguishes between ASD, ADHD, and their overlap in preschool children**.

#### **3. Intellectual Property Strategy**

To secure **freedom to operate (FTO)** and establish **competitive protection**, our project will pursue the following IP strategies:

- **Patent application for the AI-driven eye-tracking diagnostic framework**, particularly focusing on **differentiating ASD-ADHD comorbidity using gaze and pupillary biomarkers**.
- **Software copyright protection** for **the machine-learning algorithms and proprietary data processing models**.
- **Potential licensing agreements with ET hardware providers** (e.g., Tobii, Pupil Labs) to integrate our diagnostic model with **existing, commercially available ET devices**.
- **Data protection and regulatory compliance**, ensuring **GDPR and HIPAA-aligned protocols** for managing sensitive pediatric eye-tracking data.
