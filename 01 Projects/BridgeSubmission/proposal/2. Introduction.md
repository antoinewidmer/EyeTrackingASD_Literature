### 2.1.1 Clinical state of research
ADHD and ASD are detected through a combination of behavioral assessments, standardized diagnostic tools, and increasingly, objective biomarkers such as eye-tracking and neurophysiological measures. Clinicians rely on structured interviews and parent or teacher questionnaires to gather information on a child’s behavior across different settings. For ASD, widely used assessments include the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2), which involves direct observation of social and communicative behaviors, and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), a comprehensive parent interview focusing on social interaction, language, and repetitive behaviors. In contrast, ADHD is commonly assessed using rating scales such as the Conners Rating Scale and the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale, which evaluate symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity based on reports from parents and teachers.

Both disorders are formally diagnosed using criteria outlined in the DSM-5. ADHD is characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that last for at least six months and significantly impact daily life in at least two settings, such as home and school. Symptoms must appear before the age of twelve. ASD, on the other hand, is diagnosed based on persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, coupled with restricted and repetitive behaviors. These symptoms must be present early in development and cause significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Cognitive and neuropsychological tests can further aid in diagnosis by assessing executive function, attention control, and social cognition. For ASD, theory of mind tasks evaluate a child's ability to understand others’ emotions and intentions, while executive function tests assess cognitive flexibility and planning. For ADHD, continuous performance tests (CPTs) measure attentional control and impulsivity, while tasks like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) help evaluate cognitive flexibility and problem-solving abilities.

Emerging research is moving towards objective diagnostic methods that rely on biomarkers. Eye-tracking technology has shown promise in differentiating ASD and ADHD by analyzing subtle gaze behaviors. Studies have found that children with ASD exhibit reduced fixation on faces and eyes, a preference for non-social stimuli, and longer latencies when disengaging from visual stimuli. In contrast, children with ADHD demonstrate increased rapid eye movements (saccades), weaker vergence responses, and reduced pupil dilation during cognitive tasks, which indicate attentional control difficulties. These biomarkers provide an early and quantitative means of distinguishing between the two conditions, addressing the limitations of subjective diagnostic assessments.

In addition to eye-tracking, neurophysiological and imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) are being explored for their potential in ASD and ADHD detection. EEG measures brain wave activity, revealing differences in sensory processing between ASD and ADHD. fMRI studies highlight distinct neural connectivity patterns associated with each disorder. Another promising approach is heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, which has shown that individuals with ASD often exhibit reduced autonomic regulation.
