ASD:

Characterized by early onset, usually before the age of three, due to genetic variations impacting neuronal development. It manifests as significant challenges in communication and social interaction, accompanied by limited interests and repetitive behaviors. The impact of ASD is particularly profound during the early years of life when social and cognitive development occurs through imitation, play, and interaction with others. Social interaction obstacles can hinder the acquisition of essential skills, highlighting the importance of early intervention for optimal development. The prevalence of ASD is estimated at about 0.8% to 1% of the population in Switzerland, with most facilities located in the canton of Vaud, which has over ten institutions. These facilities cater to people with intellectual disabilities, and there are no structures specifically for autistic individuals. In the United States, the prevalence is 1 in 44 children, and screening should occur during well-child visits between 18 and 24 months. However, waiting lists for evaluations can extend up to 27 months, with the median age of diagnosis being four years.

ADHD:

Affecting 5% to 7% of children, with over 4.5 million children under 18 diagnosed in the United States, this disorder persists into adulthood in about 60% of cases. Studies show a dysfunction in brain metabolism
as the cause of the disorder. It is characterized by difficulties in maintaining attention and concentration, organizing daily activities, completing mundane or intellectual tasks, procrastination, impulsivity/hyperactivity, excessive talking, and a tendency for thrill-seeking. It can also involve significant difficulties in emotion regulation, especially anger. Although genetic factors play a significant role in the etiology of ADHD, numerous

environmental factors contribute to its development and maintenance (e.g., prematurity, exposure to co

ntam-

inants, or substance use during pregnancy). A recent globa
