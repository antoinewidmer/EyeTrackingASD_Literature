The state of the art regarding the use of virtual reality (VR) to train social skills needed in the workplace for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) reveals promising results.

**Efficacy of VR Interventions**

- **VR systems are effective in enhancing social skills and self-efficacy** among individuals with autism.
- A study showed a statistically significant increase in perceived self-efficacy following engagement with a VR system (P=.02).
- VR provides a safe and realistic environment for individuals with autism to master specific social skills through repetitive practice.
- VR interventions can significantly increase perceived self-efficacy in practicing social skills within a workplace context.
- VR-based interventions can serve as a valuable tool for enhancing social skills in children with ASD.
- VR-based interventions facilitate a secure and comfortable environment for individuals with ASD to practice social skills.

**Key Components of VR Training Programs**

- **WorkplaceVR**, a VR system, offers simulations of work-related social situations and data-driven reflection on users’ behavioral and physiological responses.
- VR systems should incorporate features and design considerations based on the self-efficacy theory.
- **Inclusive and iterative design** is essential to create a safe and less stressful virtual environment, incorporating feedback from individuals with autism.
- The system design should consider mastery experience by simulating real-world scenarios.
- Incorporate a feedback model where a user’s behavioral and physiological sensor data can be reviewed immediately following the simulation experience, allowing for situational reflection.

**Targeted Social Skills**

- Most studies focus on training various skills for social interaction.
- **Job-interview skills** are frequently addressed in VR-intervention studies.
- VR-based training programs can target communication skills, problem-solving, emotional skills, and social competence.
- Social interaction with virtual avatars or peers is a prominently targeted skill area.

**VR Technologies Used**

- VR can be presented with various tools such as Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) and Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), and even desktop or laptop computers.
- VR HMDs are goggles presenting virtual environments that provide a sense of surrounding the user completely.
- **Desktop-based systems** emerged as the most frequently used.
- Cooperative VR environments (supporting multiple users simultaneously) are also believed to be effective for social skills training.

**Benefits of VR Interventions**

- **Increased self-awareness** among participants about social situations that trigger their anxiety.
- Participants can gain insights into their real-world behaviors and self-advocate their characteristics to others based on their data.
- VR allows users to reflect on their physiological data, promoting self-awareness of their emotions.
- VR enables people with ASD to safely practice their social interactions, communication skills, and emotional intelligence.
- VR fosters personalized experiences and offers immediate feedback to promote effective skill development.
- The appeal of new technologies encourages engagement and active learning among users.

**Limitations and Considerations**

- Most studies have a **low number of participants with ASD**, and female participants are underrepresented.
- Individual considerations should be taken into account when applying various technologies.
- Some individuals may have sensory issues that make a high immersive CAVE more feasible than HMDs.
- VR technology may lead to side effects such as dizziness, eye fatigue, and sensory overload, particularly in immersive settings.
- Long-term, high-frequency VR interventions (especially those lasting 6 to 15 weeks with 2-3 sessions per week) demonstrate the most effectiveness.

**Recommendations for Future Research**

- Studies should apply virtual and augmented reality with more rigorous designs involving established and evidenced-based intervention strategies.
- Future research and development should focus on participatory design and include stakeholders who also communicate without using speech.
- Future studies should investigate these tools further as soft- and hardware developments have increased the usability of HMDs.
- Future research should incorporate more diverse samples in terms of age and gender and conduct comparative analyses of different VR systems.
- There is a need for more studies on gender balance in VR research.
- Researchers should optimize VR interventions to meet the personalized needs of different subgroups of patients with ASD and conduct large-scale longitudinal studies to validate their long-term impact.


AI can significantly enhance virtual reality (VR) to train social skills needed in the workplace for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

**AI-enhanced Emotion Recognition and Feedback**

- **Facial Expression and Emotion Detection** AI can be used for facial detection and the recognition of facial emotions. This allows the VR system to respond dynamically to the user's emotional state, providing tailored feedback and adjusting the difficulty level of the training scenarios.
- **Personalized Support** AI can analyze a user’s emotional state and offer assistance, creating a more responsive and supportive learning environment.
- **AI-enhanced Emotion Recognition** AI models, such as support vector machines, deep neural networks, and decision trees, can be used to detect facial emotions through webcams and augmented reality (AR) devices, improving emotion recognition accuracy.
- **Empathic Virtual Humans** Virtual characters can provide empathic feedback, helping students gain a deeper understanding of empathy.

**Adaptive and Personalized Training**

- **Customization** AI facilitates the customization of avatars, leading to a stronger sense of participant identification.
- **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment** The "Wizard of Oz" technique, where an operator monitors the game and dynamically adjusts the difficulty level based on the participant’s responses, can be enhanced with AI to automate and personalize the adaptation process.
- **Personalized Scenarios** AI can create personalized social scenarios, allowing therapists to offer more dynamic and adaptable intervention plans while children practice social behaviors in realistic but controlled environments.
- **Tailored Approaches** Given that VR interventions show different effects for individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) and low-functioning autism (LFA), AI can help tailor approaches based on cognitive, social, and sensory processing skills.
- **Adaptive Prompts** AI can implement adaptive prompts in VR-based social skills training, improving social interaction scores.

**Integration with Physiological Data**

- **Real-time Analysis** AI algorithms can estimate anxiety levels by analyzing physiological data and predict a participant's anxiety.
- **Data Reflection and Emotional Awareness** By reflecting on physiological data marked during VR simulations, AI can guide users to raise their emotional awareness by relating it to their real-world experiences.
- **Behavioral Insights** AI can help users gain insights into their real-world behaviors by analyzing their data, enabling them to proactively devise strategies for self-comfort in anticipation of similar situations.
- **Monitoring and Adjustment** AI can also monitor game play and dynamically adjust the level of difficulty based on the participant’s responses.

**AI Companions**

- **Virtual AI Companions** A virtual AI companion can assist users in remembering steps, offering new challenges, and providing positive feedback, aiding the learning process.
- **STEM Education and Social Skills** AI companions can be integrated into VR environments designed to teach Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, enhancing social skills and communication capabilities.

**Limitations and Future Directions**

- **Bias Mitigation** AI-based emotion recognition systems can be prone to biases. Future research should address these biases to ensure fair and accurate emotion detection across diverse individuals with ASD.
- **Inclusivity** Current systems often focus on individuals with autism who are able to communicate and interact with others. Future research should explore how VR interventions, enhanced by AI, can also benefit participants with autism who have different communication abilities.
- **Algorithm Rigor** Future studies should investigate and apply more rigorous algorithms that can predict the anxiety levels of participants to estimate anxiety moments more accurately.
