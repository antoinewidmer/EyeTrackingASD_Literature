Here is a literature review discussing innovative approaches to using virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to train social skills for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the workplace, incorporating references from the provided sources:

**Introduction** Virtual Reality (VR) offers promising avenues for social skills training for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), particularly in the workplace. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with VR can significantly enhance the adaptability, personalization, and effectiveness of these interventions [[@kim2024]]. This literature review explores innovative approaches that leverage AI to improve VR-based social skills training for individuals with ASD, addressing key areas such as personalized difficulty adjustment, multi-modal sensory integration, gamification, realistic virtual humans, AI-guided data reflection, bias mitigation, accessibility, and real-world integration.

**AI-Driven Personalized Difficulty Adjustment** One innovative approach involves using AI to personalize the difficulty level of VR scenarios based on real-time analysis of a participant’s physiological and behavioral responses. This enhanced "Wizard of Oz" technique uses AI to monitor metrics such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, eye contact, and speech volume, tailoring scenarios to match individual anxiety and skill levels. Kim et al. (2024) demonstrated the potential of data-driven reflection in VR interventions, enabling users to investigate their emotional reactions and connect these insights to real-world practices.

**Multi-Modal Sensory Integration** To balance engagement and usability, multi-modal sensory integration combines immersive and non-immersive VR [[@altin2025]]. AI can adapt the level of sensory stimulation based on an individual's real-time feedback, adjusting the intensity of visual and auditory stimuli to prevent sensory overload while maintaining engagement. This approach ensures interventions effectively address the diverse sensory needs of individuals with ASD.

**Gamification for Long-Term Engagement** Incorporating gamification elements can sustain long-term user engagement. AI can analyze user behavior and preferences to dynamically create personalized game elements and rewards, maintaining motivation over extended periods. This ensures continued participation and reinforces learned social skills.

**Realistic Virtual Humans** The use of realistic virtual humans can significantly impact learning among people with ASD. AI can generate avatars with nuanced and realistic facial expressions and body language, enhancing the transfer of skills to real-world interactions. Poglitsch et al. note the importance of emotion recognition and expression in XR technologies for individuals with ASD.

**AI-Guided Data Reflection** VR systems can be designed to use AI to analyze a user’s behavioral and physiological data, presenting reflective questions tailored to the individual’s experience. This AI-guided data reflection helps users gain deeper insights into their emotional reactions and connect these insights to their real-world practices, promoting greater self-awareness and understanding.

**Bias Mitigation in AI Systems** Addressing biases in AI-based emotion recognition systems is crucial for ensuring fair and accurate emotion detection across diverse individuals with ASD. Training AI models on diverse datasets and continuously monitoring their performance can identify and correct biases, promoting inclusivity and fairness in VR-based training.

**Accessibility for Diverse Communication Abilities** Expanding the benefits of VR interventions to participants with autism who have different communication abilities is essential. This involves developing AI-powered interfaces that support non-verbal communication and personalized feedback mechanisms, making VR training more accessible and effective for a broader range of individuals with ASD.

**Integration with Real-World Settings** Augmented Reality (AR) elements can bridge the gap between virtual training and real-world application. AI can provide real-time feedback and support in workplace settings via smart glasses or wearable devices, helping individuals with ASD generalize their social skills in practical, everyday scenarios. Liu et al. (2017) highlight the feasibility of AR systems for social communication and behavioral coaching.

**Incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs)** Integrating LLMs into interactive scenarios can infuse avatars with vitality, elevating user engagement and interactivity. LLMs can make scenarios more versatile and adaptable for learning emotion recognition and expression, providing more natural and context-aware interactions.

**Limitations and Future Directions** Several limitations must be addressed to advance the field. Poglitsch et al. (2024) note the scarcity of long-term studies and the absence of gamification elements for long-term motivation. Future research should focus on longitudinal investigations, incorporating LLMs, and refining AI algorithms to predict anxiety levels more accurately. Additionally, studies should address the ethical implications of using AI in VR interventions, ensuring user privacy and data security.

**Conclusion** Integrating AI into VR-based social skills training holds significant potential for enhancing the effectiveness, personalization, and accessibility of interventions for individuals with ASD in the workplace. By focusing on innovative approaches such as personalized difficulty adjustment, multi-modal sensory integration, gamification, realistic virtual humans, AI-guided data reflection, bias mitigation, accessibility, and real-world integration, VR can be transformed into a powerful tool for fostering social competence and improving workplace success for individuals with ASD.
