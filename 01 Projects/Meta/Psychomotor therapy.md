# Psychomotor Therapy and Sensory Integration in Neurodevelopmental Disorders

## Overview of Psychomotor Therapy and Sensory Integration

Psychomotor therapy (PMT) is a movement-based therapeutic approach that integrates physical activities with psychological and sensory elements to support development. It often involves exercises targeting balance, coordination, body awareness, and sensory stimulation through play. This approach aligns with the principles of sensory integration (SI) theory, which posits that appropriate sensory–motor experiences can help the brain organize and interpret sensory information for adaptive responses ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=Ayres%20began%20to%20publish%20work,and%20practice%20emanated%20from%20a) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=Early%20on%2C%20Ayres%20,functions%3A%20arousal%20regulation%2C%20static%20and) ). In neurodevelopmental disorders, sensory processing difficulties are common – for example, an estimated 90%–95% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical responses to sensory input ([Introduction - Sensory integration therapy for children with autism and sensory processing difficulties: the SenITA RCT - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK581602/#:~:text=Difficulty%20in%20processing%20sensory%20information,or%20additional%20%E2%80%98safe%20space%E2%80%99%20needs)). Similar sensory integration problems are documented in other conditions (e.g. many children with ADHD or Developmental Coordination Disorder have sensory modulation issues ( [Sensory Processing Problems in Children with ADHD, a Systematic Review - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3149116/#:~:text=about%20sensory%20problems%20in%20children,more%20severe%20sensory%20processing%20problems) ) ( [Sensory Processing Impairments in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9600147/#:~:text=Children%20with%20DCD%20showed%20significant,DCD%20in%20order%20to%20facilitate) )). Psychomotor therapy uses structured movement and play activities to engage multiple senses (vestibular, proprioceptive, tactile, visual, auditory) in order to improve sensory processing and motor skills. The goal is to improve the child’s ability to integrate sensory input and produce appropriate motor and behavioral responses, ultimately enhancing daily functioning and participation.

## Psychomotor Therapy in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

Children with ASD frequently have sensory processing challenges – they may be over- or under-sensitive to stimuli, which can exacerbate behavioral and social difficulties ([Introduction - Sensory integration therapy for children with autism and sensory processing difficulties: the SenITA RCT - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK581602/#:~:text=difficulties%20may%20exacerbate%20social%20communication,affecting%20participation%20in%20daily%20life)). Occupational therapy using sensory integration (OT-SI) techniques is a common PMT approach for ASD, aiming to improve how the child’s nervous system modulates and integrates sensory information. Over the past decade, an increasing number of studies (including randomized controlled trials) have evaluated the efficacy of sensory integration-based psychomotor interventions in autism. A 2015 systematic review of Ayres Sensory Integration® (ASI) therapy for ASD found moderate evidence supporting its use, though results for more generalized “sensory-based interventions” were mixed ([Effectiveness of Ayres Sensory Integration® and Sensory-Based Interventions for People With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26356655/#:~:text=This%20systematic%20review%20examines%20the,methods%20in%20examination%20of%20SBIs)). Subsequently, high-quality trials have strengthened the evidence base. For example, Schaaf et al. (2014) conducted a manualized SI intervention in young children with autism (30 sessions over 10 weeks) and reported that the treated group showed significant gains in goal attainment, self-care independence, and socialization compared to usual care controls ([An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: a randomized trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24214165/#:~:text=This%20study%20evaluated%20a%20manualized,fidelity%20and%20use%20of%20a)). The effect sizes were substantial (d = 1.2 for goal attainment), indicating meaningful functional improvements ([An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: a randomized trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24214165/#:~:text=of%20autism%20was%20confirmed%20using,use%20of%20this%20intervention%20for)). Another pilot RCT by Pfeiffer et al. (2011) found that children with ASD receiving SI-based therapy showed greater improvement in individualized goals and a reduction in autistic mannerisms, relative to a fine-motor training control group ( [Effectiveness of Sensory Integration Interventions in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Pilot Study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3708964/#:~:text=assigned%20to%20a%20fine%20motor,studies%20for%20children%20with%20ASD) ).

Systematic reviews in recent years generally conclude that SI-focused psychomotor therapy can be beneficial for ASD. An evidence review by Watling & Hauer (2015) noted positive outcomes in daily living skills and recommended using fidelity measures to ensure the intervention adheres to SI principles ([Effectiveness of Ayres Sensory Integration® and Sensory-Based Interventions for People With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26356655/#:~:text=therapy%20for%20people%20with%20autism,methods%20in%20examination%20of%20SBIs)). A subsequent review by Schoen et al. (2019) applied rigorous criteria (Council for Exceptional Children standards) and found that Ayres Sensory Integration qualifies as an evidence-based practice for children with autism ages 4–12, based on multiple studies including two RCTs ( [A systematic review of ayres sensory integration intervention for children with autism - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6590432/#:~:text=remaining%20three%20studies%20were%20rated,Research%20and%20Wiley%20Periodicals%2C%20Inc) ) ( [A systematic review of ayres sensory integration intervention for children with autism - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6590432/#:~:text=respectively%20met%20100,Research%20and%20Wiley%20Periodicals%2C%20Inc) ). In these studies, improvements have been observed in sensory processing, motor skills, and functional skills like self-care and social participation. For instance, one trial reported that ASD children who received SI therapy had significantly better ability to perform daily routines and social activities (as rated by parents) than those who did not ([An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: a randomized trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24214165/#:~:text=of%20autism%20was%20confirmed%20using,use%20of%20this%20intervention%20for)). There is also emerging evidence that psychomotor rehabilitation can reduce core autism symptoms: a multicenter Italian study found that after 6 months of neuro-psychomotor therapy, children with ASD showed significant improvement on an autism severity composite score (p < 0.0001), including reductions in problem behaviors and better social communication ( [Efficacy of Neuro-Psychomotor Approach in Children Affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Multicenter Study in Italian Pediatric Population - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8465075/#:~:text=in%20southern%20Italy%20%28Campania%20Region%29,such%20domains%20as%20the%20problems) ). While these findings are encouraging, authors note that larger trials are needed to confirm long-term effects ( [Efficacy of Neuro-Psychomotor Approach in Children Affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Multicenter Study in Italian Pediatric Population - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8465075/#:~:text=Our%20preliminary%20results%20suggest%20the,this%20specific%20type%20of%20approach) ).

Key outcomes for ASD: Overall, psychomotor and SI interventions in ASD tend to yield improvements in sensory modulation (children become more regulated in response to sensory input) and in functional skills or goal attainment that matter for everyday life ([An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: a randomized trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24214165/#:~:text=of%20autism%20was%20confirmed%20using,use%20of%20this%20intervention%20for)). Some studies also report enhanced social responsiveness or play skills ( [Effectiveness of Sensory Integration Interventions in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Pilot Study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3708964/#:~:text=assigned%20to%20a%20fine%20motor,studies%20for%20children%20with%20ASD) ). However, not all domains show change – for example, some trials did not find significant improvements in standardized autism symptom scales or cognitive scores beyond the targeted functional gains ( [Effectiveness of Sensory Integration Interventions in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Pilot Study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3708964/#:~:text=social%E2%80%93emotional%20factors,studies%20for%20children%20with%20ASD) ). The evidence base, while growing, highlights the importance of using well-defined SI protocols. When interventions adhere to core sensory integration principles (individualized, child-led activities providing a “just-right” sensory challenge), they are more likely to produce positive outcomes ( [A systematic review of ayres sensory integration intervention for children with autism - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6590432/#:~:text=Ayres%20Sensory%20Integration%20intervention%20is,the%20Council%20for%20Exceptional%20Children) ). ASD guidelines (e.g. NICE in the UK) have recognized sensory integration therapy as a promising, yet still investigational, approach; further research is ongoing (such as the large SenITA trial in the UK) to solidify recommendations ([Introduction - Sensory integration therapy for children with autism and sensory processing difficulties: the SenITA RCT - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK581602/#:~:text=management%20and%20support%20of%20children,across%20a%20range%20of%20contexts)).

## Psychomotor Therapy in ADHD

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is primarily characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, but many children with ADHD also exhibit sensory processing abnormalities. A systematic review found that sensory processing problems are more common in children with ADHD than in typical children, with no distinct differences between ADHD subtypes ( [Sensory Processing Problems in Children with ADHD, a Systematic Review - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3149116/#:~:text=255%20abstracts%20on%20sensory%20processing,problems%20in%20children%20with%20ADHD) ). For example, some ADHD children are over-responsive to sensory stimuli (e.g. overwhelmed by noise or touch), while others have poor body awareness or vestibular processing issues. These sensory deficits can aggravate self-regulation difficulties and impact motor coordination. Psychomotor therapy for ADHD often involves physical exercises, balance and rhythm activities, or sensory-rich play to help modulate arousal levels and improve motor planning. While research in this area is less extensive than in ASD, emerging evidence suggests movement-based interventions yield beneficial effects for ADHD symptoms.

Regular physical activity itself has been shown to improve ADHD-related outcomes. A recent network meta-analysis of 18 studies (823 participants) examining various exercise interventions reported significant improvements in core ADHD symptoms: hyperactivity/impulsivity was reduced with a large effect size (SMD ≈ –1.0) and inattention with a moderate effect (SMD ≈ –0.65) compared to non-active controls ([Frontiers | Comparative effectiveness of various physical exercise interventions on executive functions and related symptoms in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and network meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1133727/full#:~:text=The%20NMA%20on%20major%20symptoms,the%20physical%20exercise%20interventions%20were)). Notably, activities with structured, repetitive movement (“closed-skill” exercises) were ranked as particularly effective for improving attention and reducing hyperactive behavior ([Frontiers | Comparative effectiveness of various physical exercise interventions on executive functions and related symptoms in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and network meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1133727/full#:~:text=S18%20%29%20and%20inattention%20,69%20Appendix%202%20S11)). These findings align with the rationale behind psychomotor therapy – engaging the child in goal-directed motor activities can help regulate their level of alertness and focus.

Direct studies of sensory integration-oriented therapy in ADHD are fewer, but some have reported positive outcomes. In one randomized trial of Ayres Sensory Integration for children with ADHD, investigators found improvements in attention and cognitive–perceptual tasks after the intervention, though this study had a small sample (noted in a 2019 review) ([ayres sensory integration for the children with attention deficit and ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329420368_AYRES_SENSORY_INTEGRATION_FOR_THE_CHILDREN_WITH_ATTENTION_DEFICIT_AND_HYPERACTIVITY_DISORDER_ADHD_A_RANDOMIZED_CONTROLLED_TRIAL#:~:text=ayres%20sensory%20integration%20for%20the,to%20the%20study%27s%20results%2C)). Another analysis from Asia examining multiple conditions found that sensory integration therapy had a large average effect for ADHD (pooled effect size ~1.06) ( [Effectiveness of sensory integration therapy in children, focusing on Korean children: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10955541/#:~:text=For%20the%20effect%20size%20of,Table%202) ), suggesting clinically meaningful benefits, though the evidence was drawn from a mix of study designs. These improvements may manifest as better impulse control, enhanced fine-motor skills, or increased ability to tolerate sensory input in the environment. On the motor side, children with ADHD often have co-occurring motor coordination issues. A controlled trial that combined psychomotor therapy with behavioral therapy in ADHD showed additive benefits in motor proficiency and psychosocial functioning, relative to behavioral therapy alone ([Comparative effectiveness of various physical exercise interventions ...](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1133727/full#:~:text=Comparative%20effectiveness%20of%20various%20physical,therapy%20on%20children%20with%20ADHD)). Parents and teachers frequently report that kids in movement-based programs are calmer, more attentive, and better able to participate in class. While pharmacological treatment remains first-line for moderate-severe ADHD, clinical guidelines encourage adjunctive non-pharmacological interventions – including behavioral and exercise therapies – especially for young children (2025_Davis et al._Behavioral characteristics of toddlers later identified with an autism diagnosis, ADHD symptoms, or.pdf) (2025_Davis et al._Behavioral characteristics of toddlers later identified with an autism diagnosis, ADHD symptoms, or.pdf). Psychomotor therapy can be one such complementary approach to address aspects of ADHD that medication may not fully resolve (like motor clumsiness or sensory seeking behaviors).

Key outcomes for ADHD: Movement and sensory integration interventions in ADHD tend to show improvements in self-regulation and motor skills. Children may become less fidgety and more organized after participating in structured physical play that challenges their vestibular and proprioceptive systems. Some studies note improved executive function (e.g. better inhibitory control) following several weeks of intensive physical activity programs ([Frontiers | Comparative effectiveness of various physical exercise interventions on executive functions and related symptoms in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and network meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1133727/full#:~:text=The%20NMA%20on%20major%20symptoms,the%20physical%20exercise%20interventions%20were)). However, research gaps remain – many studies have small samples or lack control groups. The promising results from exercise trials need to be replicated specifically with formal psychomotor therapy programs. Future RCTs targeting sensory processing deficits in ADHD (e.g. using SI protocols to reduce sensory over-responsivity) would help clarify which ADHD subgroups benefit most. Overall, current evidence suggests that incorporating sensory–motor therapies can be a valuable adjunct for ADHD, improving symptoms and related skills beyond what traditional behavioral therapy or medication alone might achieve.

## Psychomotor Therapy in Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD)

Developmental Coordination Disorder is characterized by marked impairment in motor coordination and praxis, often accompanied by delays in acquiring motor skills (e.g. tying shoes, handwriting). Importantly, recent research indicates that children with DCD also have underlying sensory processing deficits across multiple domains ( [Sensory Processing Impairments in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9600147/#:~:text=The%20outcome%20measures%20were%20sensory,areas%2C%20which%20might%20contribute%20to) ). A 2022 systematic review found significant impairments in DCD children’s ability to integrate visual, tactile, proprioceptive, vestibular, and auditory inputs compared to peers ( [Sensory Processing Impairments in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9600147/#:~:text=Children%20with%20DCD%20showed%20significant,DCD%20in%20order%20to%20facilitate) ). In other words, their difficulties in motor planning and execution are partly rooted in poor sensory integration. This has led to the use of sensory integration therapy and psychomotor rehabilitation in DCD. The aim is to improve the child’s processing of sensory feedback so that motor skills can develop more smoothly. Indeed, experts suggest that including SI-based activities in DCD rehabilitation is important to facilitate better participation in daily activities ( [Sensory Processing Impairments in Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9600147/#:~:text=integration%2C%20and%20oral%20integration%20processes,facilitate%20participation%20in%20daily%20activities) ).

Empirical studies on PMT for DCD show gains in specific motor outcomes. In Switzerland, psychomotor therapy is a standard school-based intervention for children with graphomotor (handwriting) impairments, many of whom have DCD. A recent randomized field trial with 121 young children (some diagnosed with DCD, others with dysgraphia) examined a 5-month course of psychomotor therapy. The results demonstrated significant improvement in fine motor skills (as measured by a standardized test) for the PMT group compared to a waitlist control ( [Effectiveness of Psychomotor Therapy among Children with Graphomotor Impairment with and without DCD-Diagnosis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10297145/#:~:text=children%20completed%20a%20self,children%20improved%20more%20than%20the) ). Children who received therapy also reported a better self-concept regarding their handwriting abilities, whereas the control group’s self-perception did not change ( [Effectiveness of Psychomotor Therapy among Children with Graphomotor Impairment with and without DCD-Diagnosis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10297145/#:~:text=therapy%20group%20showed%20partial%20improvements,showed%20no%20effects%20on%20handwriting) ). This suggests that beyond objective motor gains, the intervention helped children feel more competent and confident in their motor tasks. However, the study found no significant difference in actual handwriting fluency or letter formation speed between the treated and untreated groups over that short term ( [Effectiveness of Psychomotor Therapy among Children with Graphomotor Impairment with and without DCD-Diagnosis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10297145/#:~:text=children%20completed%20a%20self,children%20improved%20more%20than%20the) ). This indicates that some higher-level motor skills might require longer intervention or additional strategies to improve.

Another line of evidence comes from sensory-focused interventions. For instance, an RCT in 2021 investigated Ayres Sensory Integration therapy for children with DCD and reported improvements in motor coordination and daily function after a short-term, intensive SI program ([Examining the Effectiveness of Ayres Sensory Integration ...](https://www.cureus.com/articles/322081-examining-the-effectiveness-of-ayres-sensory-integration-intervention-for-children-with-developmental-coordination-disorder-in-improving-motor-coordination-and-daily-activity-function-a-randomized-controlled-trial#:~:text=Examining%20the%20Effectiveness%20of%20Ayres,function%20in%20children%20with%20DCD)). Although published in a less traditional forum, it echoed that a tailored sensory–motor approach can boost motor proficiency (balance, bilateral coordination) in DCD. Additionally, occupational therapy literature documents that CO-OP (Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance) and SI techniques can complement each other: the former gives cognitive strategies, while the latter provides the sensorimotor foundation needed for motor learning. In clinical practice, DCD interventions often blend motor skill training with sensory-rich activities (e.g. obstacle courses that challenge balance and body awareness). Families of children with DCD commonly report progress in everyday skills – like riding a bicycle or improved posture – when such integrative therapies are used consistently.

Key outcomes for DCD: Psychomotor therapy tends to yield improvements in fundamental motor skills (gross and fine) and can enhance the child’s confidence in movement-related activities ( [Effectiveness of Psychomotor Therapy among Children with Graphomotor Impairment with and without DCD-Diagnosis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10297145/#:~:text=therapy%20group%20showed%20partial%20improvements,showed%20no%20effects%20on%20handwriting) ). Gains in core motor coordination (e.g. better postural control and balance) are frequently noted, which in turn support daily functions like handwriting, self-care, and play. The evidence base, while positive, is still developing. Many studies are small or uncontrolled, but their findings converge on the idea that addressing the sensory underpinnings of DCD can lead to better motor outcomes. Future research is focusing on longer-term effects – for example, whether early psychomotor intervention in preschool can alter the developmental trajectory and reduce the need for services later in childhood. There is also interest in identifying which sensory systems (vestibular, proprioceptive, etc.) are most related to DCD, so that therapy can target those systems more precisely to improve motor planning.

## Neurobiological and Theoretical Mechanisms Linking Movement to Sensory Modulation

Why would movement-based therapy improve sensory integration? The theoretical foundation comes from A. Jean Ayres’ sensory integration theory and has been supported by emerging neuroscience evidence. Key sensory systems – vestibular (balance and motion), proprioceptive (body position), and tactile (touch) – have extensive neural connections to brain regions responsible for arousal regulation, attention, emotion, and motor control ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=Early%20on%2C%20Ayres%20,functions%3A%20arousal%20regulation%2C%20static%20and) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=Widespread%20vestibular%20influences%20on%20behavior,important%20role%20in%20learning%20and) ). For example, vestibular signals (from the inner ear) project to the brainstem and cerebellum to help coordinate posture and eye movements, but they also influence the reticular activating system and limbic structures that modulate alertness and mood ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=Early%20on%2C%20Ayres%20,functions%3A%20arousal%20regulation%2C%20static%20and) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=behavioral%20difficulties%20of%20children,She%20further%20speculated%20that) ). Ayres hypothesized that providing controlled vestibular input (through activities like swinging, spinning, or balance exercises) could normalize a child’s arousal level and improve their ability to focus and learn ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=behavioral%20difficulties%20of%20children,She%20further%20speculated%20that) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=the%20vestibular%20system%20could%20be,level%20cortical%20functioning%20was%20considered) ). Modern research supports this: stimulating the vestibular system can engage wide networks and potentially enhance higher-level cognitive functioning by stabilizing sensory processing at a brainstem level ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=Early%20on%2C%20Ayres%20,functions%3A%20arousal%20regulation%2C%20static%20and) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=and%20proprioception%2C%20the%20vestibular%20system,22%2C23%2C24%5D%20and%20Mailloux) ).

Similarly, proprioceptive input (heavy work, resistance, joint compression) is thought to have a calming and organizing effect on the central nervous system. Deep pressure and muscle work activate tactile-proprioceptive pathways that can reduce sensory over-reactivity (“fight or flight” responses) and improve body scheme awareness. This is why many psychomotor interventions use weighted objects, climbing, or squeezing games – these are believed to help kids who are either “sensory seeking” or “sensory avoiding” find a more regulated state. The theoretical mechanism is that by engaging the child in meaningful sensory-motor activities at an appropriate challenge level, the therapy induces the brain to form new, more efficient connections for processing sensory information. In neuroscience terms, it leverages neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to reorganize in response to experience ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=5) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=promotes%20neuroplasticity,challenge%20to%20facilitate%20adaptive) ). Enriched environments and active sensory experiences have been shown in animal studies to increase synaptic density and improve sensory discrimination ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=concept%20provided%20an%20important%20foundation,explore%20and%20engage%20with%20the) ). In therapy, when a child successfully integrates multiple sensations to accomplish a task (for example, maintaining balance on a moving swing while catching a ball), it is believed to strengthen neural networks that underlie sensory integration and praxis. Over time, repeated practice under guided conditions can lead to more automatic regulation of sensory input in everyday situations ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=5) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=promotes%20neuroplasticity,challenge%20to%20facilitate%20adaptive) ).

Neuroimaging research provides some support for these mechanisms. Studies have found that children with sensory processing disorders (including many with ASD or ADHD) show atypical connectivity in brain networks such as the thalamus and parietal regions (which are hubs for multisensory integration) ([Perspectives on sensory processing disorder: a call for translational ...](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/integrative-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/neuro.07.022.2009/full#:~:text=Perspectives%20on%20sensory%20processing%20disorder%3A,A%20recent%20subspecialty%20in)). After interventions, preliminary findings (e.g. using EEG or evoked potentials) suggest possible normalization in sensory gating and improved brain responses to stimuli ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=match%20at%20L680%20neuroplasticity,the%20brain%E2%80%99s%20ability%20to%20manage) ). One ongoing study is measuring changes in neural activity pre- and post-SI therapy in ASD, to directly test whether functional brain changes accompany behavioral improvements ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=match%20at%20L680%20neuroplasticity,the%20brain%E2%80%99s%20ability%20to%20manage) ). While this field is young, it underscores that movement-based therapies are not just “active play” – they are intentionally designed sensory exercises that can reshape neural processing. In summary, the link between movement and sensory modulation is grounded in our understanding that sensory systems drive motor output and vice versa. By training the two in tandem (through psychomotor activities), therapy targets the root of sensory–motor integration problems, promoting better adaptive responses through plastic changes in the brain ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=5) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=promotes%20neuroplasticity,challenge%20to%20facilitate%20adaptive) ).

## Outcomes and Effectiveness: Summary of Evidence

Overall, evidence-based literature supports the effectiveness of psychomotor and sensory integration therapies for many children with neurodevelopmental disorders, though outcomes vary by individual and domain. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that these interventions can yield moderate to large improvements in sensory processing and functional skills. For instance, a 2024 meta-analysis of pediatric studies reported robust effect sizes for sensory integration therapy in ASD and ADHD populations (standardized mean differences ~1.3 for autism and ~1.1 for ADHD) ( [Effectiveness of sensory integration therapy in children, focusing on Korean children: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10955541/#:~:text=For%20the%20effect%20size%20of,Table%202) ). These are large effects, comparable to some pharmacologic or behavioral treatments, highlighting that well-implemented sensorimotor programs can significantly impact a child’s development. In Autism, multiple RCTs have demonstrated gains in goal-directed behaviors, self-care independence, and decreased sensory symptoms following PMT/SI interventions ([An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: a randomized trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24214165/#:~:text=of%20autism%20was%20confirmed%20using,use%20of%20this%20intervention%20for)). Parents often observe that children become calmer and more engaged in daily activities after a course of SI therapy ([Introduction - Sensory integration therapy for children with autism and sensory processing difficulties: the SenITA RCT - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK581602/#:~:text=Sensory%20modulation%20difficulties%20%28i,also%20likely%20to%20affect%20peer)) ([An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: a randomized trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24214165/#:~:text=occupational%20therapy%20intervention%20scored%20significantly,for%20practice%20and%20future%20research)). In ADHD, controlled trials of exercise-based therapy show reductions in hyperactivity and better attention control, translating to improved classroom behavior and executive function ([Frontiers | Comparative effectiveness of various physical exercise interventions on executive functions and related symptoms in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and network meta-analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1133727/full#:~:text=The%20NMA%20on%20major%20symptoms,the%20physical%20exercise%20interventions%20were)). For DCD, although fewer RCTs exist, available studies show improved motor coordination and fine-motor skills, which can enhance academic performance (e.g. handwriting) and self-esteem ( [Effectiveness of Psychomotor Therapy among Children with Graphomotor Impairment with and without DCD-Diagnosis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10297145/#:~:text=children%20completed%20a%20self,children%20improved%20more%20than%20the) ).

It is important to note that not every study finds uniform benefits, and some outcomes (like core diagnostic symptoms of autism or ADHD) may not change dramatically with psychomotor therapy alone. The interventions tend to be most effective in improving proximal issues – sensory modulation, motor skills, and specific adaptive behaviors – rather than “curing” the disorder. Additionally, methodology varies: interventions labeled as “sensory integration” can differ in intensity, activities, and therapist training, which affects results. High-quality studies emphasize using manualized protocols and fidelity checks (ensuring the therapist follows SI principles closely). When these quality measures are in place, the outcomes are more consistently positive ([Effectiveness of Ayres Sensory Integration® and Sensory-Based Interventions for People With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26356655/#:~:text=life%20activities%20and%20occupations,methods%20in%20examination%20of%20SBIs)) ([An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: a randomized trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24214165/#:~:text=better%20on%20measures%20of%20caregiver,for%20practice%20and%20future%20research)). Another consideration is duration and setting: short-term improvements are well documented, but we need more data on long-term maintenance. Some studies with follow-ups suggest that gains can persist for months after therapy ends, especially if parents and teachers continue to provide sensory-rich opportunities for the child. But in other cases, booster sessions or ongoing support may be needed to sustain the benefits.

In practice, the effectiveness of psychomotor therapy is often evaluated in terms of functional goals (using tools like Goal Attainment Scaling) rather than only standardized test scores. This approach captures meaningful changes for the child and family, such as learning to tolerate haircuts (sensory goal) or riding a bike (motor goal). Such individualized outcomes have indeed shown significant improvement in SI trials ([An intervention for sensory difficulties in children with autism: a randomized trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24214165/#:~:text=of%20autism%20was%20confirmed%20using,use%20of%20this%20intervention%20for)). Furthermore, meta-analyses differentiate between individual therapy and group therapy: one review found individual one-on-one SI therapy had a moderate effect (d ~0.5), whereas group-based sensory motor sessions had a smaller effect (d ~0.26) ( [Effectiveness of sensory integration therapy in children, focusing on Korean children: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10955541/#:~:text=For%20the%20effect%20size%20of,Table%202) ). This suggests that the personalized, child-centered nature of one-on-one therapy might be key to success, allowing activities to be tailored to the child’s specific sensory profile.

## Gaps in Research and Future Directions

Despite promising evidence, several gaps and challenges remain in this field. Current research limitations include:

- Heterogeneity of Interventions: “Psychomotor therapy” and “sensory integration” can encompass a wide range of techniques. Studies often use different activities, making it hard to compare results. Future research should aim for more standardized protocols or clearly describe the intervention’s components to enable replication ( [Effectiveness of sensory integration therapy in children, focusing on Korean children: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10955541/#:~:text=Sensory%20integration%20intervention%20is%20highly,analysis) ). The use of fidelity measures (such as the Ayres SI Fidelity Measure) is encouraged to ensure consistency across studies ([Effectiveness of Ayres Sensory Integration® and Sensory-Based Interventions for People With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26356655/#:~:text=life%20activities%20and%20occupations,methods%20in%20examination%20of%20SBIs)).
- Sample Sizes and Study Design: Many studies to date have small sample sizes or quasi-experimental designs. More large-scale RCTs are needed, particularly for ADHD and DCD where data are sparse. For example, while ASD has seen multiple RCTs, ADHD trials of SI-based therapy are few and often not blinded or well-controlled. Larger multicenter trials (like the ongoing ones in ASD in the UK and Europe) could provide more definitive evidence and address variability across populations.
- Outcome Measures: There is a need for more objective and standardized outcome measures of sensory integration progress. Researchers are exploring neurophysiological measures (EEG, fMRI) to see if changes in brain activity accompany clinical improvements ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=match%20at%20L680%20neuroplasticity,the%20brain%E2%80%99s%20ability%20to%20manage) ). Incorporating such measures could strengthen causal claims that the therapy is driving neurodevelopmental changes. Additionally, long-term follow-up is often lacking; future studies should assess whether improvements in early childhood translate to lasting benefits in adolescence (e.g. better academic achievement or social integration).
- Mechanism Clarity: While the theoretical mechanisms are plausible, direct evidence linking specific neural changes to therapy is still limited. Future directions include studies that examine how dosage and specific sensory inputs correlate with outcomes – e.g. is vestibular input the critical ingredient for improving attention in ADHD, or is proprioceptive input more crucial? Understanding this could allow therapies to be tailored to individual sensory profiles for maximum effect.
- Populations and Personalized Approaches: More research is needed to identify which subgroups of children respond best. Neurodevelopmental disorders are heterogeneous. It’s possible that children with severe sensory modulation disorders gain the most from SI, whereas those with primarily motor planning issues might need a different emphasis. Additionally, nearly all studies focus on children; exploring psychomotor therapy for adolescents or adults with longstanding sensory issues (for instance, teens with autism who still struggle with sensory overload) is an open area. Early indications are that even older individuals can benefit from sensorimotor strategies, but formal trials are few.
- Integration with Other Therapies: Future studies might examine combined interventions (e.g. psychomotor therapy plus cognitive-behavioral techniques). Some early work suggests synergistic effects – for example, improved sensory regulation might make behavioral therapy more effective by reducing a child’s baseline anxiety or distractibility. Understanding how PMT can be integrated into school programs or family routines is also important for real-world impact.

In conclusion, psychomotor therapy with a focus on sensory integration shows significant promise for addressing sensory processing and motor difficulties in ASD, ADHD, DCD, and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Empirical evidence – including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and RCTs – generally supports its positive impact on sensory modulation and functional skills. Children often demonstrate better adaptive responses to sensory input, improved coordination, and progress in daily activities following such interventions. The neurobiological rationale, grounded in sensory system neuroscience and neuroplasticity, provides a strong theoretical backbone for these clinical findings ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=5) ) ( [Neural Foundations of Ayres Sensory Integration® - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680650/#:~:text=Early%20on%2C%20Ayres%20,functions%3A%20arousal%20regulation%2C%20static%20and) ). As research advances, we can expect more refined interventions and clearer guidance on how to match therapies to individual needs. While there are gaps to fill, the convergence of current literature indicates that movement-based, sensory-focused therapies are a valuable component of developmental rehabilitation – one that bridges the body and brain to help children thrive in their environments.
