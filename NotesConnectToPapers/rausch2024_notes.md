## üìå Summary

- The study validates the **German version of the RAADS-R (RADS-R)**, a self-report screening instrument for **adult autism assessment**.
- The **original RAADS-R** (80-item questionnaire) is widely used and included in **NICE guidelines**.
- The study involved **299 participants**, including **110 with ASD, 64 with primary mental disorders (PMD), and 125 controls**.
- RADS-R achieved **high sensitivity (92.5%) and specificity (93.6%)**, with an **optimal threshold of 81**.
- It performed **similarly to other screening tools** (AQ, EQ, SRS) but had a **unique sensory-motor component**.
- The **four-factor structure of the original RAADS-R** was not fully replicated in the German version.
- The **RADS-R showed strong construct validity**, correlating significantly with other autism assessments.
- A **shortened 14-item version (RADS-14)** also showed **high validity** but with slightly lower sensitivity.
- The tool may help **reduce diagnostic delays** for adults seeking autism assessment in German-speaking regions.


## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- **Validation study** of the **German-translated RAADS-R** (RADS-R).
- Compared **self-reported scores** with previously diagnosed ASD cases.
- Evaluated **sensitivity, specificity, and factor structure**.
- **Compared results** with other screening tools (**AQ, EQ, SRS**).
- Conducted **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)**.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean, SD)|IQ (Mean, SD)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**ASD**|110|63/47|40.1 (13.01)|113.63 (16.53)|
|**PMD**|64|25/39|36.6 (13.57)|101.00 (12.78)|
|**Control**|125|68/57|36.86 (13.57)|112.43 (15.12)|
|**Total Sample**|299|156/143|37.99 (13.42)|110.29 (15.82)|

- **Inclusion Criteria**: Age **18-65 years**, **German native speakers**.
- **Exclusion Criteria**: Psychiatric disorders in the **control group** were screened using **SCID-I**.



### Tasks for Participants

- **Self-report questionnaire** completed **independently** (unlike original RAADS-R study, which included clinician guidance).
- **Comparison with Other Autism Measures**:
    - **Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)**
    - **Empathy Quotient (EQ)**
    - **Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)**

|Task Name|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|**RADS-R (80 items)**|Screening for autism traits|Self-report questionnaire|Total score and four subscale scores|
|**AQ**|Autism traits assessment|Self-report questionnaire|Autism likelihood|
|**EQ**|Empathy levels|Self-report questionnaire|Emotional response ability|
|**SRS**|Social responsiveness assessment|Completed by a close contact|Social skill deficits|


### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|**Wechsler Intelligence Test (WIE)**|IQ assessment (Cologne site)|Standardized test|
|**Mehrfach Wortschatz Test (MWT-B)**|Verbal intelligence assessment|Standardized test|
|**Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFT-20-R)**|Nonverbal IQ test (Freiburg site)|Standardized test|

- Participants **received questionnaires by mail**.
- **No clinician assistance** was provided, making it a **fully self-administered tool**.

|**Factor Analysis (EFA & CFA)**|Examines underlying structure|RADS-R|



## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings:

- **RADS-R performed well as an autism screener** in **German-speaking adults**.
- **Sensitivity (92.5%) and specificity (93.6%) were high** at the threshold **score of 81**.
- **Compared to AQ, EQ, and SRS**:
    - **RADS-R had better sensitivity than AQ** but slightly lower specificity.
    - **RADS-R performed similarly to EQ and SRS**.
- **Factor analysis did not fully support the original four-factor model**, suggesting potential **overlapping constructs**.
- The **RADS-14 (short version)** had **strong correlation (r = 0.97)** with RADS-R but with slightly lower sensitivity.
- **Older ASD participants scored higher**, possibly due to **self-awareness or sample bias**.



### Implications for the Project (MOSAIC)

- **Provides a validated self-report ASD screening tool** in German-speaking populations.
- Could be **integrated into MOSAIC's multimodal approach** to **validate ASD subtypes**.
- **Sensory-motor domain inclusion aligns with MOSAIC's focus** on neurodevelopmental disorder markers.
- **Potential to streamline adult autism diagnosis**, reducing delays in clinical assessment.



## üîç Related Work

- **Builds on the original RAADS-R validation** (Ritvo et al., 2011).
- **Similar validation studies in Sweden, France, and the UK** showed **comparable sensitivity/specificity**.
- **Other autism measures (AQ, EQ, SRS) have been widely used** but **lack sensory-motor components**.
- **Addresses the lack of standardized ASD screening in German-speaking adults**.



## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

‚úÖ **Large and diverse sample (N=299), including ASD, PMD, and controls**.  
‚úÖ **Validated a German-language ASD screening tool**.  
‚úÖ **Compared RADS-R with widely used screening tools (AQ, EQ, SRS)**.  
‚úÖ **High sensitivity and specificity**.  
‚úÖ **Self-administered format makes it practical for clinical use**.  
‚úÖ **Included sensory-motor subscale**, which many other tools lack.



### Major Concerns and Challenges

üö® **Factor analysis issues** ‚Üí The original **four-factor model was not fully replicated**, suggesting **overlapping constructs**.  
üö® **No validation in diagnosis-seeking populations** ‚Üí Participants were **pre-diagnosed**, limiting its use as a **first-line screener**.  
üö® **No control for "camouflaging" in females** ‚Üí Many women with ASD **mask symptoms**, which could **affect test accuracy**.  
üö® **Potential self-report bias** ‚Üí Without clinician oversight, some participants **may over- or under-report symptoms**.  
üö® **Lack of differentiation from PMD group** ‚Üí **Some psychiatric disorders share ASD-like traits**, potentially **inflating false positives**.  
üö® **Not tested in real-world clinical settings** ‚Üí Needs **validation in general psychiatric populations** seeking **initial assessment**.



## Final Thoughts

The **RADS-R is a promising ASD screening tool** for **German-speaking adults**, with **high diagnostic accuracy**. While **practical for self-report use**, further **refinement of its factor structure and real-world validation in clinical settings** is needed. For **MOSAIC**, incorporating **sensory-motor assessments** and **cross-validation with eye-tracking and behavioral data** could enhance **multimodal ASD screening**.
