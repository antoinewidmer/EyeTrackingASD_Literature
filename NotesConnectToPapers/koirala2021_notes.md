## üìå Summary

- The study explores the use of a Virtual Reality-based Sensory Assessment (SAVR) system to assess visual and touch sensory processing in adolescents with ASD.
- Sensory abnormalities are prevalent in 90-95% of individuals with ASD, impacting their daily functioning.
- The SAVR system provides an objective, interactive approach compared to traditional questionnaire-based assessments like the AASP.
- Results demonstrated that SAVR detected more sensory differences between ASD and TD participants than AASP.
- Findings suggest that VR can serve as a sensitive, engaging, and objective tool for sensory processing assessment.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Controlled experimental study comparing ASD and TD participants using the SAVR system.
- Combination of subjective (AASP questionnaire) and objective (VR-based) sensory assessments.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ASD|12|11/1|14.25 ¬± 2.18|ASD diagnosis (ADOS-G)|
|TD|12|6/6|14.5 ¬± 2.18|No developmental conditions|

### Tasks for Participants

Participants played a painting game with visual and tactile sensory components.

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Painting Game|Assess visual & tactile response|Maze navigation in VR|Gaze, painting speed, touch force|
|Distraction Response|Analyze gaze reaction|Rotating 3D objects|Fixation duration, saccade velocity|
|Touch Sensory Response|Evaluate tactile responses|Maze contact via haptic|Lift distance, press force|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|Tobii Pro X-30|Eye-tracking|20-30 Hz sampling|
|Touch Robot (3D Systems)|Haptic feedback device|Force feedback in 4 modes|
|Unity 3D Engine|VR game environment|Interactive maze game|
|Monitor Display|Visual stimuli display|Standard computer monitor|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Gaze Distribution|Visual tasks|Proportion of gaze on maze vs. distractions|
|Fixation Duration|Visual tasks|Duration of gaze fixation on different objects|
|Saccade Metrics|Visual tasks|Duration and velocity of saccadic eye movements|
|Painting Speed|Touch tasks|Speed of maze painting|
|Touch Pressure|Touch tasks|Force applied to maze surface|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- SAVR detected significant sensory differences between ASD and TD participants that were not captured by AASP.
- ASD participants showed reduced gaze distribution and more focused fixation patterns.
- ASD participants exhibited lower lift distance and painting speed, indicating tactile sensitivity.
- The system revealed that visual depth cues influenced attention patterns more in TD participants.

### Implications

- VR-based sensory assessments offer a promising complement to traditional methods like the AASP.
- Objective data from biosensors can provide richer insights into sensory processing differences.
- The system could be adapted to other sensory domains (e.g., auditory, olfactory) for broader application.

## üîç Related Work

- Extends previous research on VR applications in ASD for social and motor training.
- Aligns with findings that sensory sensitivities affect social interactions and daily activities in ASD.
- Contributes to computational psychiatry efforts to develop objective diagnostic tools.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Novel use of VR to assess visual and tactile processing simultaneously.
- Objective biosensor data reduces bias inherent in self-report measures.
- Interactive game format enhances participant engagement and data quality.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Small sample size limits the generalizability of findings.
- Limited gender diversity, especially in the ASD group.
- Eye-tracking data loss occurred due to calibration issues and participant movement.
- Task novelty may confound results, as participants might respond differently when familiarized.
- The haptic feedback device may not accurately mimic real-world tactile sensations.

The study demonstrates VR's potential for sensory assessment in ASD but underscores the need for larger, more diverse samples and refined sensory stimuli delivery techniques.
