## üìå Summary

- The study investigates the differences in whole-body goal-directed movements between autistic and neurotypical children using virtual reality and motion capture.
- Autistic children were less efficient in their movements, taking longer and using less direct paths.
- Autistic children showed less strategy modulation compared to neurotypical peers, particularly when adjusting for target distance.
- The findings suggest potential implications for daily activities, highlighting the need for tailored motor interventions.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Experimental study using immersive virtual reality to analyze movement efficiency, variability, and accuracy.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Age Range|Additional Characteristics|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Autistic|16|14/2|10.63 ¬± 1.82|7-13|Confirmed ASD diagnosis via ADOS-2 and ADI-R|
|Neurotypical|12|7/5|9.25 ¬± 1.91|7-13|No ASD diagnosis or related family history|

### Tasks for Participants

- Participants performed the Safe Zone Task, moving a virtual ball to a green safe zone by shifting their body laterally.

|Task Component|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Safe Zone Task|Measure goal-directed movement|VR-mediated body movement|Success rate, time, path efficiency|
|Near vs. Far Zones|Assess strategy modulation|Varying target distances|Overshoot/undershoot rates|
|Trial Learning|Assess learning effect over trials|16 repeated trials|Trial duration, success changes|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|CAREN VR System|Virtual reality environment|V-Gait system with motion tracking|
|Motion Analysis Cameras|Track movement|12-camera 120 Hz infrared setup|
|MATLAB|Data processing|Custom analysis scripts|
|Reflective Markers|Track participant movement|Placed on anatomical landmarks|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task Relationship|Measurement Approach|
|---|---|---|
|Trial Duration|Measure task completion time|Time from task start to target entry|
|Path Efficiency|Assess movement strategy|Path ratio: actual vs. optimal path|
|Path Variability|Analyze movement consistency|Coefficient of variability|
|Overshoots|Strategy for near targets|Movements passing the target|
|Undershoots|Strategy for far targets|Movements stopping before the target|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- Autistic children were equally successful but took longer to complete the task.
- Movements of autistic children were less efficient and followed less direct paths.
- Neurotypical children adapted their strategy for near and far targets; autistic children did not.
- Path variability was higher for both groups when targeting near distances.

### Implications

- Motor differences in autism may contribute to daily activity challenges.
- Movement inefficiencies may increase fatigue and reduce engagement in activities.
- VR-based motor assessments could help tailor interventions for autistic children.

## üîç Related Work

- Prior studies show autistic individuals have differences in postural control and upper-body movements.
- Movement differences may stem from altered visuomotor integration and motor planning.
- The study extends previous findings by focusing on whole-body movements in dynamic contexts.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Innovative use of immersive VR with precise motion capture.
- Detailed analysis of task strategy differences.
- Practical implications for intervention development.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Limited sample size reduces generalizability.
- Possible learning effects from repeated trials were not extensively analyzed.
- The exclusion criteria were strict, potentially omitting relevant motor profiles.
- The study did not examine long-term motor adaptation or daily task performance impact.
