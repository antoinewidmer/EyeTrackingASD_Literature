## üìå Summary

- The study introduces **TELE-ASD-PEDS-Preschool (TAP-Preschool)**, a novel telemedicine tool designed to **reduce disparities in early autism diagnosis**.
- The tool integrates **machine learning, stakeholder input, and clinician expertise** to optimize remote ASD assessments for **preschool-aged children**.
- TAP-Preschool focuses on **underserved populations**, particularly **racial/ethnic minorities and families with limited healthcare access**.
- Pilot results indicate that TAP-Preschool successfully **identifies ASD with moderate accuracy (63%)** but is more effective in **confirming existing ASD diagnoses** than ruling them out.
- Clinician feedback highlights **the need for integration with parent-reported history** to improve diagnostic certainty.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### **Key Findings**

- TAP-Preschool successfully **confirmed existing ASD diagnoses (80%)**, but **misclassified 30% of non-ASD cases**.
- Clinicians had **higher certainty** when confirming ASD but required **parent-reported history** to rule it out effectively.
- Parents reported **high satisfaction** with the process, but some requested **more preparation and flexibility** in materials.
- The tool performed better for **minimally verbal children**, indicating that **language ability impacts assessment accuracy**.

### **Implications**

- TAP-Preschool has potential to **expand early ASD diagnosis in underserved populations**.
- **Hybrid telehealth approaches**, integrating parent reports, could improve accuracy.
- Future work should refine **cultural adaptations and caregiver guidance materials**.

## üîç Related Work

- Builds on **existing telehealth ASD tools**, such as **TELE-ASD-PEDS and ADEC-V**, by extending assessments to preschoolers.
- Supports previous research on **remote behavioral observation for early ASD detection**.
