## üìå Summary

- The study investigates the **spatiotemporal eye movement dynamics** in autistic children to understand face prioritization in early visual processing.
- A **computational hidden Markov model (HMM) approach** was used to analyze gaze patterns in a **large, well-characterized sample**.
- Autistic children exhibited **more exploratory eye movement patterns**, characterized by **reduced fixations on faces** early in visual processing.
- Eye movement patterns were **associated with clinical ASD characteristics**, including **adaptive function, face recognition ability, and autism symptom severity**.
- The study provides **biomarker insights** that could inform **future diagnostic and intervention strategies** for autism.


## üî¨ Methods

### **Study Design**

- **Longitudinal eye-tracking study** conducted at **three time points** (baseline, 6 weeks, 24 weeks).
- Computational **hidden Markov modeling (HMM)** was used to analyze gaze transitions between **regions of interest (ROIs)** in face images.
- Participants viewed **three different social eye-tracking assays** using static and dynamic stimuli.

### **Participants**

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Autistic|280|215/65|8.55 ¬± 1.64|ASD (ADOS-2, DSM-5 confirmed)|
|Neurotypical|119|83/36|8.51 ¬± 1.61|No psychiatric conditions|



### **Tasks for Participants**

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Static Social Scenes**|Assess face prioritization|Viewing static images|Gaze fixations, transitions|
|**Visual Exploration**|Measure exploratory vs. focused patterns|Exploring face & non-face stimuli|Fixation sequences, transition matrices|
|**Activity Monitoring**|Examine gaze behavior during social tasks|Viewing real-world activity videos|Eye movement trajectories|



### **System Setup and Hardware**

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|**Eye-tracker**|Gaze fixation & saccade tracking|High-speed infrared camera (120Hz)|
|**Screen Display**|Present stimuli|High-resolution LCD (24 inches)|
|**HMM Software**|Gaze pattern modeling|MATLAB-based EMHMM toolbox|



### **Data Analysis**

|Feature|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Fixation Probability**|All tasks|Probability of initial fixation on a face ROI|
|**Gaze Transition Patterns**|All tasks|Likelihood of moving between different ROIs|
|**Exploratory vs. Focused Score**|All tasks|Quantifies eye movement strategy|
|**HMM Cluster Similarity**|All tasks|Measures how individual gaze behavior aligns with clusters|


## üìä Results & Key Findings

### **Key Findings**

- **Autistic children showed more exploratory eye movements**, with a lower probability of fixating on faces early in viewing.
- **Neurotypical children prioritized face ROIs more rapidly**, demonstrating a **focused viewing strategy**.
- Exploratory eye movement patterns were **significantly correlated** with higher **ADOS-2 autism severity scores**.
- Autistic children had **lower face recognition memory scores (NEPSY-II)**, suggesting a relationship between **eye movement patterns and social cognition**.
- Eye movement patterns remained **stable over the 24-week period**, indicating that these gaze behaviors are **trait-like markers** of autism rather than momentary variability.

### **Implications**

- The study provides **strong evidence** that **early visual processing strategies** in autism differ fundamentally from neurotypical individuals.
- These **gaze dynamics may serve as biomarkers** for ASD, aiding in **early diagnosis and individualized intervention**.
- The findings support **theory-driven models of autism**, such as **reduced social orienting and atypical neural specialization for faces**.
