## üìå Summary

- The study presents the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a conceptual framework for harmonising mental health data.
- The ICF is used to align diverse psychiatric data with contemporary paradigms such as transdiagnostic, neurodiversity, and positive psychology approaches.
- The study provides a proof of principle using the Risk and Resilience in Developmental Diversity and Mental Health (R2D2-MH) consortium.
- 138 mental health measures from various datasets were linked to the ICF to improve data comparability.
- The study highlights the potential of ICF-based harmonisation for creating more inclusive and holistic mental health datasets.

## üèõ Rationale

- The growing interest in retrospectively harmonising mental health data requires structured frameworks that align with contemporary psychiatric paradigms.
- Traditional psychiatric research is often siloed into diagnostic categories, limiting cross-study comparability and integration.
- The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a comprehensive and inclusive approach to understanding mental health beyond diagnostic labels.
- By adopting ICF as a framework, researchers can better capture the interplay between biological, psychological, and environmental factors in mental health conditions.
- The study aims to demonstrate how the ICF framework can facilitate large-scale data integration in a way that aligns with transdiagnostic, neurodiversity-affirmative, and positive psychology approaches.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Retrospective data harmonisation aligning psychiatric datasets with the ICF framework.
- Linking of mental health measures using WHO‚Äôs ICF linking rules.

### Data Sources

- Mental health data from the R2D2-MH consortium.
- Datasets included cohorts with autism, ADHD, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and other neurodevelopmental conditions.

### Linking Procedure

- 138 mental health measures were linked to ICF categories.
- Manual review and assignment of ICF codes to mental health assessment tools.
- Evaluation of inter-rater agreement to ensure consistency in linking.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- ICF provides a structured approach to harmonising psychiatric data across multiple domains.
- Data mapping revealed significant overlaps across different mental health measures.
- The study demonstrates how transdiagnostic and neurodiversity-affirmative approaches can be integrated into data harmonisation.
- Environmental factors were underrepresented in existing datasets, highlighting a need for broader data collection approaches.

### Implications

- ICF-based harmonisation aligns with contemporary mental health paradigms.
- Future research should incorporate environmental and social determinants of mental health to enhance the utility of harmonised datasets.
- The methodology supports a more nuanced understanding of psychiatric conditions beyond traditional diagnostic labels.

## üîç Related Work

- Builds on previous psychiatric research advocating for transdiagnostic approaches.
- Expands the use of the ICF framework in psychiatric data analysis.
- Aligns with research promoting strengths-based assessments in neurodiversity.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Demonstrates the feasibility of ICF-based data harmonisation in mental health.
- Introduces a structured and replicable methodology for integrating diverse psychiatric datasets.
- Provides a conceptual framework that can be extended to other mental health research initiatives.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Existing datasets may lack sufficient coverage of environmental and social factors.
- The harmonisation process is subject to subjective interpretation, requiring further validation.
- ICF lacks specificity in capturing certain psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions.
- More research is needed to develop quantitative harmonisation techniques beyond conceptual mapping.

This study presents a foundational approach to harmonising mental health data using the ICF, with potential applications for more inclusive and holistic psychiatric research frameworks.
