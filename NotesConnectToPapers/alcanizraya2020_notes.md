## üìå Summary

- The study explores the application of supervised machine learning to identify behavioral biomarkers of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using electrodermal activity (EDA) and virtual reality (VR).
- Sensory processing differences between ASD and typically developing (TD) children were assessed in virtual forest and city environments.
- EDA signals recorded during multimodal sensory stimulation (visual, auditory, and olfactory) were used to train machine learning models.
- The model achieved up to 90.3% accuracy in differentiating ASD from TD participants.
- The study supports using VR-based environments and physiological markers for more objective ASD diagnostics.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Two-phase experimental design: exploratory (Experiment 1) and confirmatory (Experiment 2).
- Children participated in virtual reality environments while EDA was measured to differentiate sensory responses.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ASD|29|26/3|5.20 ¬± 1.34|DSM/ICD-based clinical diagnosis|
|TD|23|13/10|4.87 ¬± 0.92|Neurotypical|

### Tasks for Participants

Participants completed tasks involving greeting responses and imitation of avatars in virtual environments with varying sensory stimuli.

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Greeting Interaction|Assess social response to greetings|Virtual forest environment|EDA, behavioral response|
|Avatar Imitation|Evaluate imitation behaviors|Virtual city environment|EDA, imitation accuracy|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|Empatica E4 Wristband|EDA measurement|4 Hz sampling|
|CAVE VR System|Immersive VR environment|3-wall projection|
|Olorama Technology|Olfactory stimuli|Wireless scent dispenser|
|Logitech Z906|Audio delivery|5.1 surround sound|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Baseline tonic EDA|All tasks|Skin conductance level before stimuli|
|Phasic EDA response|All tasks|Short-term EDA response to stimuli|
|EDA ratio (tonic/phasic)|All tasks|Ratio of baseline to response EDA|
|Stimuli modality response|Test trials|EDA differences by sensory modality|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- The forest environment with combined visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli yielded 90.3% accuracy in ASD detection.
- Visual-only stimuli achieved 84.6% accuracy, suggesting visual sensitivity in ASD.
- The city environment yielded lower accuracy (70.5%), indicating task-dependent variability.
- Phasic EDA responses were more relevant for ASD detection than tonic components.

### Implications

- VR combined with physiological biomarkers can provide objective measures for ASD assessment.
- Multimodal stimuli in naturalistic environments improve classification accuracy.
- Phasic EDA responses may reflect sensory hyper-responsiveness in ASD.

## üîç Related Work

- Aligns with prior research on sensory dysfunction in ASD.
- Extends findings by using multimodal VR and machine learning for ASD detection.
- Highlights potential for integrating VR tools in clinical assessments.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Use of immersive VR for ecologically valid assessment.
- Integration of multiple sensory modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
- High classification performance with a simple wearable device (Empatica E4).

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Small sample size with limited gender diversity in the ASD group.
- No investigation of potential confounding variables (e.g., cognitive ability or sensory sensitivities).
- VR novelty effect might have influenced the results.
- Lack of longitudinal data to assess biomarker stability.
- Limited generalizability due to age range and task specificity.

The study supports using EDA and VR-based environments as potential diagnostic tools for ASD but requires larger and more diverse participant samples for broader applicability.
