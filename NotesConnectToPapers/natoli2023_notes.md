# 📖 Summary

## Objective/Purpose:

The main goal of this review/meta-analysis is to examine potential sex differences in young autistic children across core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive development, and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing conditions. It aims to clarify whether a female-specific ASD phenotype exists that might contribute to sex-based disparities in diagnosis.

## Scope of the Review:

- The review focuses on children aged 1 to 6 years old.
- It includes core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive abilities, and co-occurring mental health conditions.
- The study is a systematic review and meta-analysis.

## Key Inclusion Criteria:

- Studies that explicitly compare male and female autistic children.
- Participants aged 1 to 6 years.
- Studies measuring core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive development, or co-occurring conditions.

## Key Exclusion Criteria:

- Studies without age-specific results.
- Non-peer-reviewed studies.
- Studies involving co-occurring medical syndromes (e.g., Fragile X).
- Animal model studies.

|**Inclusion**|**Exclusion**|
|---|---|
|ASD children aged 1-6|Non-peer-reviewed studies|
|Core ASD features, cognition, co-occurring conditions|Co-occurring syndromes|
|Formal ASD diagnosis|Non-age-specific results|

# 🔬 Methods

## Study Selection & Data Sources:

- Databases searched: Cinahl, Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science.
- Keywords: "sex or gender or male* or female* or boy* or girl*" combined with "Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, ASD".
- Screening involved two independent reviewers; disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Study Inclusion Overview:

- 7,791 initial articles.
- 4,196 after duplicate removal.
- 142 full-text screened.
- 35 included in the systematic review.
- 21 included in the meta-analysis.

## Data Extraction & Quality Assessment:

- Data extracted by two researchers independently.
- Quality assessed using the AXIS tool (average to high quality).
- Meta-analysis conducted using StataIC v16.

### Risk of Bias Assessment:

- Egger’s test used for publication bias.
- Heterogeneity assessed with I² statistic.

# 📊 Results & Key Findings

## Overview of Included Studies:

|**Metric**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Number of studies|35 (21 in meta-analysis)|
|Sample size|11,996 total (8794 males, 3202 females)|
|Study designs|Cross-sectional, longitudinal, cohort studies|
|Geographical distribution|Global, including US, Europe, and Asia|

## Main Findings:

- No significant sex differences in core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive abilities, or co-occurring conditions.
- Potential sex differences in restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) with males showing more RRBs.
- No significant differences in cognitive development.


- The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that sex differences in young autistic children are minimal and generally non-significant across core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive development, and co-occurring conditions. The notable exception is a near-significant difference in RRBs, with males showing more pronounced behaviors.

### Possible Explanations for Null Results:

#### Phenotypic Similarity:

- No genuine differences exist, and ASD manifests similarly in males and females during early childhood.

#### Diagnostic Tool Limitations:

- Standardized diagnostic tools may be male-biased, missing subtle female-specific traits.

#### Population Sampling Bias:

- Studies often include fewer females, potentially excluding those with subtler presentations.

#### Implications:

- Early diagnostic assessments may need adjustments to capture potential female phenotypes better.

Clinicians should remain cautious of sex-based assumptions during diagnosis.

#### Future Research:

- Develop tools sensitive to potential female phenotypes.

- Investigate how cognitive abilities might interact with sex differences in ASD features.

- Explore longitudinal changes that may reveal sex differences emerging over time.



### Heterogeneity & Publication Bias:

- Moderate heterogeneity found in social interaction and communication domains.
- No significant publication bias detected except for reciprocal social interaction.

# 🔍 Related Work & Theoretical Framework

- Consistent with Van Wijngaarden-Cremers et al. (2014) showing no significant sex differences.
- Aligns with Lai et al. (2015) indicating males may show more RRBs.
- The female autism phenotype remains a hypothesis; diagnostic tools may not capture subtle differences.

# 📝 Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- ✅ Large sample size (11,996 participants).
- ✅ Systematic and meta-analytic approach.
- ✅ Inclusion of cognitive development and co-occurring conditions.

### Major Concerns & Limitations

- ⚠️ Limited data on late-diagnosed females.
- ⚠️ Moderate heterogeneity in social interaction.
- ⚠️ Potential underrepresentation of autistic females with subtler phenotypes.

# 🚀 Conclusion & Future Directions

- The study suggests no significant early childhood sex differences in ASD phenotypes.
- Future research should explore differences using alternative diagnostic tools and age-specific analyses.
- Investigate late-diagnosed females to identify potential female-specific phenotypes.
