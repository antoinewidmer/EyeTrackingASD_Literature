## üìå **Summary**

- **Objective**: The study examines the **developmental trajectory of face processing** in autistic individuals using **eye-tracking and pupillometry**.
- **Methodology**:
    - **109 autistic and 150 neurotypical participants** aged **3-34 years**.
    - Measured **visual exploration and pupil dilation** in response to faces of varying social saliency.
- **Key Findings**:
    - **Autistic individuals showed invariant gaze and pupillary responses to faces over time**, while neurotypicals developed stronger **eye fixation and physiological responses** to social stimuli.
    - **Pupillary hypersensitivity in neurotypicals decreased with age**, while autistic individuals exhibited **low and stable physiological responses** across life stages.
    - Differences in **face processing** suggest **atypical maturation of social attention networks in ASD**.

## üî¨ **Methods**

### **Study Design**

- **Cross-sectional** design with participants grouped by **four age ranges** (3‚Äì7, 8‚Äì12, 13‚Äì18, 19‚Äì33 years).
- **Eye-tracking** and **pupillometry** were used to measure **gaze behavior and physiological reactivity**.
- **Face stimuli varied in social saliency** (static objects, neutral faces, emotional faces).

### **Participants**

| Characteristic        | Value |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Total Sample**     | 259 participants (3‚Äì34 years old) |
| **Autistic Group**   | 109 (93 males, 16 females) |
| **Neurotypical Group** | 150 (84 males, 66 females) |
| **Age Groups**       | 3-7, 8-12, 13-18, 19-33 years |
| **Mean Age**         | ASD: 13.03 ¬± 7.90, TD: 13.05 ¬± 7.39 |
| **CARS Score (ASD Group)** | 29.13 ¬± 5.20 |
| **Developmental Quotient (DQ, ASD Group)** | 79.72 ¬± 28.17 |
| **Exclusion Criteria** | Neurological disorders, vision impairments |


**Criticism**:

- **Severe gender imbalance (mostly males in ASD group)** limits generalizability.
- **Lack of socioeconomic or cultural factors**, which are known to impact **face processing strategies**.

### **Tasks for Participants**

| Task Name                | Purpose                                    | Format                        | Data Collected |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Visual Exploration Task** | Measure gaze behavior | Eye-tracking on static and dynamic face stimuli | Fixation time, gaze transitions |
| **Pupillometry Task** | Assess physiological reactivity | Pupil dilation in response to faces | Pupil size variations (ERPD) |
| **ADOS-2, CARS, DQ Assessments** | Validate ASD diagnosis | Standardized clinical tools | Autism severity, cognitive function |


**Criticism**:

- **Only static images and short videos were used**, lacking **real-world social interaction** elements.
- **No non-social dynamic control stimuli**, making it unclear if **motion itself** influenced responses.

### **System Setup and Hardware**

| Device | Purpose | Specifications |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **SMI RED500 Eye-Tracker** | Gaze tracking | 60 Hz sampling rate |
| **GazeTracker & SMI Experiment Center** | Data acquisition | Defines AOIs, logs fixation time |
| **MATLAB (2018a)** | Pupil Data Processing | Filters noise, computes pupil size changes |


**Criticism**:

- **60 Hz sampling rate is relatively low** for pupillometry, potentially missing **fine-grained pupil dynamics**.
- **No mention of calibration methods**, which are crucial for accurate eye-tracking data.

### **Data Analysis**

#### **Collected Features in Dataset**

| Feature Category         | Feature Name              | Related Task | Measurement Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Gaze Behavior**       | Fixation Percentage  | Visual Exploration Task | Time spent looking at eyes, nose, mouth |
| **Gaze Consistency** | Gaze Transition Frequency | Visual Exploration Task | Frequency of gaze shifts between face regions |
| **Pupillary Response**  | Event-Related Pupil Dilation (ERPD) | Pupillometry Task | Pupil dilation to different stimuli |

**Criticism**:

- **No analysis of real-time gaze shifts**, which are more informative than total fixation time.
- **No mention of eye-tracking drift correction**, which is essential for long experiments.

## üìä **Results & Key Findings**

### **Key Findings:**

- **Neurotypical participants showed increased attention to eyes with age**, while **autistic individuals had stable, lower fixation on eyes** across all age groups.
- **Pupillary reactivity to social stimuli was stronger in younger neurotypical children** but declined over time.
- **ASD participants had uniformly reduced pupil dilation across all age groups**, indicating **a lack of developmental adaptation to social saliency**.
- **ROC analysis** showed that gaze and pupillary markers could distinguish ASD and TD individuals **more reliably in childhood than in adulthood**.

---

### **Implications for the Project**

- **Supports the idea that ASD individuals follow an alternative developmental trajectory in face processing**.
- **Suggests that early eye-tracking markers could help identify ASD before behavioral symptoms become pronounced**.
- **Highlights the need for adaptive interventions to improve face-processing skills in autistic children**.

---

## üîç **Related Work**

- **Aligns with previous studies (Klin et al., 2002; Pelphrey et al., 2002) showing reduced eye fixation in ASD**.
- **Extends Martineau et al. (2011) and Sepeta et al. (2012) by demonstrating pupillometry differences across a lifespan**.
- **Contrasts with Fujioka et al. (2020), which suggested increasing eye fixation in ASD until age 10**.

## üìù **Observations**

### **Strengths of the Study**

‚úÖ **Large age range (3‚Äì34 years) provides insight into long-term ASD developmental trajectories**.  
‚úÖ **Combination of eye-tracking and pupillometry offers both behavioral and physiological insights**.  
‚úÖ **Findings support potential age-specific ASD biomarkers for early diagnosis**.  
‚úÖ **Use of dynamic face stimuli improves ecological validity compared to static-only studies**.

---

### **Major Concerns and Challenges**

‚ö† **Overgeneralization of "Invariant Response"**

- The study **implies that ASD face processing is static across life**, but **individual variability is not well explored**.
- **Cluster analysis could reveal distinct ASD subtypes with different trajectories**.

‚ö† **Low Sampling Rate in Eye-Tracking Data**

- **60 Hz is insufficient** for detecting **micro-expressions or rapid gaze shifts**.
- **Future work should use higher-resolution tracking (e.g., 120-300 Hz)**.

‚ö† **Limited Task Complexity**

- The study only used **face stimuli with neutral or basic emotions**.
- **More complex real-world interactions (e.g., joint attention, social conversations) should be tested**.

‚ö† **Potential Confounds in Pupillary Response**

- **No control for luminance changes between trials**, which could impact pupil dilation.
- **Individual differences in baseline pupil size were not accounted for**.

---

### **Final Verdict: Strong but Requires More Real-World Validation**

‚úÖ **Provides compelling evidence of ASD-specific differences in face processing**.  
‚ö† **Needs refinement in methodology, higher-resolution tracking, and individualized ASD subtyping**.  
üöÄ **Future studies should incorporate naturalistic social interactions and real-time tracking methods**.
