## üìå Summary

- The study investigates active inference differences in autistic and neurotypical adults using immersive virtual reality.
- A VR racquetball task was used to examine visual sampling behaviors and movement kinematics under different environmental volatility conditions.
- Autistic participants showed altered movement kinematics and visual sampling behaviors under volatile conditions.
- Results support the hypothesis that autistic individuals overestimate environmental volatility.
- Findings suggest that predictive processing differences in autism may contribute to motor control difficulties.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Experimental study using a virtual racquetball task to assess sensorimotor control.
- Visual sampling and movement kinematics were analyzed across stable and volatile conditions.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Autistic|26|Not specified|21.40 ¬± 5.09|Clinical ASD diagnosis (DSM/ICD)|
|Neurotypical|54|Not specified|21.78 ¬± 4.14|No developmental disorders|

### Tasks for Participants

Participants performed a virtual racquetball task requiring interception of balls under varying conditions.

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Stable Condition|Assess response under predictable cues|VR racquetball|Gaze data, kinematics, accuracy|
|Volatile Condition|Assess response under uncertain cues|VR racquetball|Gaze data, kinematics, accuracy|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|HTC Vive HMD|VR environment display|110¬∞ FOV, 90 Hz, 1440x1600 px/eye|
|Tobii Eye Tracker|Track gaze behavior|120 Hz sampling, 0.5¬∞ accuracy|
|VR Hand Controller|Record movement kinematics|90 Hz sampling|
|Unity Software|VR environment development|Custom racquetball environment|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Interception Rate|Both conditions|Success rate of ball interception|
|Swing Kinematics|Both conditions|Swing onset, peak velocity, ROM|
|Gaze Fixation Duration|Both conditions|Duration of fixation around ball bounce|
|Pre-bounce Saccade Timing|Both conditions|Timing and amplitude of anticipatory saccades|
|Gaze Tracking Error|Test trials|Angular distance between gaze and ball post-bounce|
|UE-E Gaze Tracking Difference|Test trials|Behavioral surprise in response to unexpected bounces|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- Autistic participants exhibited lower interception rates, particularly under volatile conditions.
- Autistic participants showed slower hand movements and reduced range of motion.
- Predictive gaze behavior was observed across both groups, but autistic participants had less variability.
- Eye-tracking data indicated reduced behavioral surprise to unexpected events in autistic individuals.

### Implications

- Autistic individuals may overestimate environmental volatility, leading to motor control difficulties.
- Findings align with active inference models predicting sensory integration differences in autism.
- Insights could inform motor skill interventions using adaptive VR tasks.

## üîç Related Work

- Aligns with prior research on motor control and predictive processing differences in ASD.
- Extends findings by examining context-sensitive volatility processing in VR environments.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Innovative use of immersive VR to examine sensorimotor behaviors.
- Direct manipulation of environmental volatility enhances experimental control.
- Comprehensive dataset combining gaze and motion metrics.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Small sample size, particularly for the autistic group.
- Lack of gender-specific analysis limits insight into sex differences.
- Absence of longitudinal data to assess task learning over time.
- Potential ecological validity concerns due to VR simulation context.
- Eye-tracking accuracy may be reduced by headset movement.

The study demonstrates altered predictive processing in autism but requires further research to validate findings in real-world contexts.
