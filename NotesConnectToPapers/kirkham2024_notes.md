## üìñ Summary

### Objective/Purpose

- The review explores the use of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) methods for assessing Executive Functioning (EF).
- It aims to evaluate the validity, reliability, and psychometric properties of VR-based EF assessments.
- Research questions:
    1. What EF components are assessed using VR paradigms?
    2. How are these VR assessments validated?
    3. How are potential adverse effects (cybersickness) and positive effects (immersion) managed?

### Scope of the Review

- Covers VR-based EF assessments, including inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, working memory, planning, and attention.
- Examines validation methods, psychometric considerations, and ecological validity.
- **Type:** Systematic Review

## Final Thoughts

This systematic review highlights the **promise and challenges** of using VR for EF assessment. While **validation and ecological validity** are promising, issues with **methodological standardization, cybersickness assessment, and usability** need to be addressed. Future research should prioritize **test-retest reliability and integration with biosensors** to enhance the effectiveness of VR-based executive function assessments.
