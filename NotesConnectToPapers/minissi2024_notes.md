## üìå Summary

- The study compares biosignal-based models using virtual reality (VR) and machine learning for ASD assessment.
- It examines motor skills, eye movements, and behavioral responses to distinguish between ASD and TD children.
- A VR environment with four interactive scenes was used for data collection.
- Motor skills provided the most robust classification performance (AUC = 0.89).
- Eye movement models exhibited high variability due to technical challenges.
- The study supports VR-based biosignal analysis as a promising, objective ASD assessment tool.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Comparative analysis of biosignal models for ASD classification.
- VR-based experimental setup with motor, eye movement, and behavioral response data collection.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ASD|39|32/7|53.14 ¬± 12.38|ADOS-2 diagnosis|
|TD|42|19/23|57.88 ¬± 11.62|No reported developmental issues|

### Tasks for Participants

Participants interacted with virtual objects and avatars to elicit motor, behavioral, and visual responses.

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- Motor skills models achieved the highest classification performance (AUC = 0.89).
- Behavioral models also performed well (AUC = 0.80), especially in the combined model.
- Eye movement models showed high variability due to calibration difficulties with child participants.
- Non-semantic eye movements performed better than semantic eye movements.

### Implications

- Motor skills data collected in VR can improve objective ASD diagnosis.
- VR-based assessments provide ecologically valid settings for biosignal analysis.
- Eye-tracking tools for children should be optimized for better data quality.

## üîç Related Work

- Extends prior research on motor and eye movement differences in ASD.
- Aligns with findings that motor abnormalities are prevalent in ASD populations.
- Highlights the benefits of VR-based diagnostics over traditional lab settings.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Multi-biosignal comparison within a controlled VR setting.
- Use of ecologically valid tasks to mimic real-life interactions.
- High-performance motor skill model with robust cross-validation.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Eye-tracking limitations due to equipment not designed for young children.
- Sample imbalance in terms of gender, reflecting ASD prevalence but limiting generalizability.
- Potential bias from task novelty and VR unfamiliarity.
- Limited generalizability due to a narrow age range (3-7 years).

The study demonstrates that motor skills are a promising biosignal for ASD assessment, while improvements in eye-tracking technology could enhance the methodology's reliability.
