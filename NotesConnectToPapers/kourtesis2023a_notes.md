## üìå Summary

- This study investigates the use of Virtual Reality (VR) to train social skills in adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
- It examines the acceptability, usability, and user experience of a VR system (VRESS) designed for social skills training.
- The study also explores relationships between cognitive functioning, VR social scenario performance, and the acceptability, usability, and user experience ratings.
- The research suggests that VR social skills training is a feasible and well-accepted approach for adults with ASD.
- Executive functions (EFs) appear to be implicated in social skills, and social skills are strong indicators of the functionality level in adults with ASD.

üî¨ **Methods**

- Study Design
    - The study involved a neuropsychological evaluation and three sessions of VR social skills training.
    - Participants completed five social scenarios in VR at three difficulty levels.
    - They also completed questionnaires to assess acceptability, usability, user experience, and cybersickness.

üìä **Results & Key Findings**

- Key Findings:
    - VRESS showed high acceptability, user experience, and usability among adults with ASD.
    - Performance in VR social scenarios (prompts required) significantly predicted the ASD functionality level, perceived usability of the VR system, and acceptability of VR social skills training.
    - Inhibition speed also predicted the ASD functionality level.
    - Working memory predicted ASD functionality level and VR system usability.
    - Planning ability predicted performance in VR social scenarios and VR system usability.
    - Computing and gaming experience were correlated with mental state/emotion recognition.
- Implications:
    - VR social skills training appears to be a promising and feasible approach for adults with ASD.
    - Executive functions play a role in social skills development and expression in ASD.
    - Social skills are a key indicator of the functionality level in adults with ASD.
    - An errorless learning approach in VR social skills training may result in higher acceptability and perceived usability.

üîç **Related Work**

- Current interventions for improving social skills in individuals with ASD often fail to represent the complexity of real-life social settings.
- VR interventions in ASD are still an emerging field, and more research is needed to fully understand their efficacy, usability, user experience, and acceptability.
- Existing VR applications are primarily designed for children and/or adolescents with ASD, not adults.

üìù **Observations**

- Strengths of the Study
    - The study uses a VR system (VRESS) specifically designed for adults with ASD, addressing a gap in existing VR interventions.
    - It examines multiple aspects of VR training, including acceptability, usability, user experience, social skills, and executive functions.
    - The study incorporates ecologically valid social scenarios that are relevant to everyday life.
    - The findings provide evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of VR social skills training in adults with ASD.
- Major Concerns and Challenges
    - The sample size is relatively small (n=25) and may not be fully representative of the broader ASD population.
    - The study is not a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which limits the ability to determine the efficacy of VRESS in improving social skills.
    - Task completion scores showed a ceiling effect, potentially limiting the ability to detect performance differences among participants.
    - The study acknowledges that VRESS did not offer an errorless learning approach, which may have impacted acceptability and usability ratings.
    - The generalizability of the findings may be limited by the specific characteristics of the participants (age, functionality level).
    - **Further research is needed to identify potential prognostic markers of cognitive and social functioning in ASD**.
