## üìå Summary

- The study investigates sex differences in social brain neural responses during configural face processing in autistic and non-autistic individuals.
- Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured with EEG to analyze timing differences in response to upright and inverted faces.
- Results suggest that sex and neurotype affect face processing at different time points, with sex differences appearing earlier and lasting longer.
- Autistic females showed distinct processing patterns compared to non-autistic females during childhood, but these differences reduced in adolescence and disappeared in adulthood.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Cross-sectional study analyzing EEG responses to face stimuli.
- Utilized Bootstrapped Cluster-based Permutation Analysis (BCPA) and Growth Curve Analysis (GCA).

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age Range|Mean Age (SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Neurotypical|217|141/76|6.89-30.78|17.16 (5.70)|No developmental conditions|
|Autistic|275|202/73|6.08-30.28|16.98 (5.48)|DSM-5 ASD diagnosis|

### Tasks for Participants

Participants viewed upright and inverted face images while neural responses were recorded.

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Face Viewing|Analyze configural face processing|Presentation of faces|EEG responses, eye tracking|
|Face Inversion|Examine inversion effects on processing|Upright/inverted faces|ERP components (N170, P300)|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|EEG System (64-ch)|Record neural activity|500 Hz sampling, 10-20 layout|
|MATLAB TaskEngine|Stimuli presentation|Real-time face presentation|
|Eye Tracker|Track gaze patterns|500 Hz sampling|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
|N170 Amplitude|Face Viewing|Measures configural face processing|
|P300 Amplitude|Face Viewing|Measures novelty detection|
|Inversion Effect|Face Inversion|Difference between upright and inverted faces|
|ERP Time Clusters|All tasks|Onset and duration of sex/neurotype effects|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- Neurotype differences were significant at 310 ms, whereas sex differences began at 260 ms.
- Autistic females had smaller and delayed ERP peaks compared to non-autistic females during childhood.
- Differences in ERP profiles between autistic and non-autistic females diminished with age.
- No significant age-dependent neurotype differences were found in males.

### Implications

- Face processing differences in autism may result from both perceptual and cognitive processing variations.
- Age and sex must be considered when interpreting neural responses to social stimuli.
- The observed developmental convergence between autistic and non-autistic females could influence diagnostic practices.

## üîç Related Work

- Supports prior research on atypical face processing in autism.
- Extends findings by identifying time-cluster differences based on sex and age.
- Aligns with literature on increased social attention in females compared to males.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Large sample size with robust statistical methods.
- Use of data-driven EEG analysis enhances temporal precision.
- Simultaneous consideration of sex, neurotype, and age.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Cross-sectional design limits developmental inferences.
- Unequal sex distribution, with fewer autistic females.
- EEG measures focus on one electrode (P8), potentially missing broader effects.
- Eye-tracking data quality was inconsistent across participants.
- Stimuli were static faces, which may not fully capture social attention mechanisms.

The study underscores the need for longitudinal investigations into the developmental trajectories of face processing differences in autism across sexes.
