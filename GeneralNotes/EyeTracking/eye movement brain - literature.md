## Eye movement-related brain activity during perceptual and cognitive processing


https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00062/full

For several decades researchers have been recording electrical brain activity associated with eye movements in attempt to understand their neural mechanisms. However, recent advances in eye-tracking technology have allowed researchers to use eye movements as the means of segmenting the ongoing brain activity into episodes relevant to cognitive processes in scene perception, reading, and visual search. This opened doors to uncovering the active and dynamic neural mechanisms underlying perception, attention and memory in naturalistic conditions. The present eBook contains a representative collection of studies from various fields of visual neuroscience that use this cutting edge approach of combining eye movements and neural activity.

## Microsaccade Characteristics in Neurological and Ophthalmic Disease

Microsaccade research has recently reached a critical mass of studies that allows, for the first time, a comprehensive review of how microsaccadic dynamics change in neurological and ophthalmic disease. We discuss the various pathological conditions that affect microsaccades, their impact on microsaccadic and other fixational eye movement dynamics, and the incipient studies that point to microsaccadic features as potential indicators of differential and early diagnoses of multiple clinical conditions, from movement disorders to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder to amblyopia. We propose that the objective assessment of fixational eye movement parameters may help refine differential diagnostics in neurological disease and assist in the evaluation of ongoing therapy regimes. In addition, determining the effects of ophthalmic disease on fixational eye movement features may help evaluate visual impairment in an objective manner, particularly in young patients or those experiencing communication difficulties.

When we attempt to fixate our gaze on a target, our eyes are never still, but produce small “fixational eye movements,” which include tremor, drift, and microsaccades. Microsaccades (also called fixational saccades) occur at a typical rate of 1–2 Hz. Converging research points to a saccadic generation continuum, which extends from the smallest fixational microsaccades to the largest exploratory saccades ([1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00144/full#B1)–[5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00144/full#B5)). Drift is a slow (typically less than 2°/s) motion that occurs between microsaccades and saccades, and travels in an erratic pattern that has been modeled as a random walk ([6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00144/full#B6)). Tremor (or ocular microtremor) occurs simultaneously with drift, during intersaccadic intervals. This is the smallest fixational eye movement, with amplitudes that approximate the width of a single photoreceptor and dominant frequencies between 70 and 103 Hz (averaging 84 Hz) ([7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00144/full#B7), [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00144/full#B8)). Tremor studies are much scarcer than those centered on microsaccades and/or drift, due to the technical difficulties inherent to measuring this tiny motion ([8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00144/full#B8), [9](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00144/full#B9)). Thus, we do not address tremor in this review.
