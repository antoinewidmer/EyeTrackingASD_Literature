Numerous systematic reviews summarize the evidence on the accuracy of AI models in diagnosing different mental disorders. This umbrella review aims to synthesize results of previous systematic reviews on the performance of AI models in diagnosing mental disorders. To identify relevant systematic reviews, we searched 11 electronic databases, checked the reference list of the included reviews, and checked the reviews that cited the included reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the relevant reviews, extracted the data from them, and appraised their quality. We synthesized the extracted data using the narrative approach. We included 15 systematic reviews of 852 citations identified. The included reviews assessed the performance of AI models in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease (n = 7), mild cognitive impairment (n = 6), schizophrenia (n = 3), bipolar disease (n = 2), autism spectrum disorder (n = 1), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 1), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 1), and psychotic disorders (n = 1). The performance of the AI models in diagnosing these mental disorders ranged between 21% and 100%. AI technologies offer great promise in diagnosing mental health disorders. The reported performance metrics paint a vivid picture of a bright future for AI in this field. Healthcare professionals in the field should cautiously and consciously begin to explore the opportunities of AI-based tools for their daily routine. It would also be encouraging to see a greater number of meta-analyses and further systematic reviews on performance of AI models in diagnosing other common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Abd-alrazaq","given":"Alaa"},{"family":"Alhuwail","given":"Dari"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Toro","given":"Carla T."},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Arfan"},{"family":"Alzubaidi","given":"Mahmood"},{"family":"Alajlani","given":"Mohannad"},{"family":"Househ","given":"Mowafa"}],"citation-key":"abd-alrazaq2022","container-title":"NPJ Digital Medicine","container-title-short":"NPJ Digit Med","DOI":"10.1038/s41746-022-00631-8","ISSN":"2398-6352","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,7]]},"page":"87","PMCID":"PMC9262920","PMID":"35798934","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The performance of artificial intelligence-driven technologies in diagnosing mental disorders: an umbrella review","title-short":"The performance of artificial intelligence-driven technologies in diagnosing mental disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9262920/","volume":"5"},

Early detection of ASD individuals, especially children, could help to devise and strategize right therapeutic plan at right time. Human faces encode important markers that can be used to identify ASD by analyzing facial features, eye contact, and so on. In this work, an improved transfer-learning-based autism face recognition framework is proposed to identify kids with ASD in the early stages more precisely. Therefore, we have collected face images of children with ASD from the Kaggle data repository, and various machine learning and deep learning classiﬁers and other transfer-learning-based pre-trained models were applied. We observed that our improved MobileNet-V1 model demonstrates the best accuracy of 90.67% and the lowest 9.33% value of both fall-out and miss rate compared to the other classiﬁers and pre-trained models. Furthermore, this classiﬁer is used to identify different ASD groups investigating only autism image data using k-means clustering technique. Thus, the improved MobileNet-V1 model showed the highest accuracy (92.10%) for k = 2 autism sub-types. We hope this model will be useful for physicians to detect autistic children more explicitly at the early stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Akter","given":"Tania"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Mohammad Hanif"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Md.

  {"id":"anjum2024","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological developmental disease that appears in a variety of ways[8]. Most autistic children are not diagnosed until they are at least three years old [6] [13]. Abnormal facial traits caused by development abnormalities are strongly linked to underlying neurological issues [2]. Newborns with ASD have facial development that differs significantly from that of typically developing children [3]. Early detection is crucial to help the parents and families in denial and superstition. Differentiating facial features from normally developing children is a clear way to identify children diagnosed with ASD. In this work, we proposed a facial feature-based ASD detection method. This study uses different deep-learning models to recognize autistic children using only a facial image dataset. This work used five pre-trained CNN models as feature extractors: MobileNet, Xception, VGG16, VGG19, EfficientNet, and a binary classifier to detect autism in children effectively. To train these feature extraction models, we utilized a publicly available Kaggle dataset containing 2940 images of autistic and non-autistic children. The proposed method could detect ASD and non-ASD from the facial images of children. Using CNN models as feature extractors and Logistic regression as a binary classifier, we achieved an accuracy rate approaching 88.33% on test data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Anjum","given":"Jaasia"},{"family":"Hia","given":"Naosin Akhter"},{"family":"Waziha","given":"Anika"},{"family":"Kalpoma","given":"Kazi A"}],"citation-key":"anjum2024","collection-title":"AICCONF '24","container-title":"Proceedings of the Cognitive Models and Artificial Intelligence Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3660853.3660888","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"979-8-4007-1692-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,23]]},"page":"155–159","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction from Children's Facial Images for Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3660853.3660888"},

New evidence indicates disruption to motor timing and integration may underpin the disorder, providing a potential new computational marker for its early identification. In this study, we employed smart tablet computers with touch-sensitive screens and embedded inertial movement sensors to record the movement kinematics and gesture forces made by 37 children 3–6 years old with autism and 45 age- and gender-matched children developing typically. Machine learning analysis of the children’s motor patterns identified autism with up to 93% accuracy. Analysis revealed these patterns consisted of greater forces at contact and with a different distribution of forces within a gesture, and gesture kinematics were faster and larger, with more distal use of space. These data support the notion disruption to movement is core feature of autism, and demonstrate autism can be computationally assessed by fun, smart device gameplay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Anzulewicz","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Sobota","given":"Krzysztof"},{"family":"Delafield-Butt","given":"Jonathan T."}],"citation-key":"anzulewicz2016","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep31107","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,24]]},"language":"en","page":"31107","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Toward the Autism Motor Signature: Gesture patterns during smart tablet gameplay identify children with autism","title-short":"Toward the Autism Motor Signature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31107","volume":"6"},

The factors underlying this predominance of males are largely unknown, but the way girls score on standardized categorical diagnostic tools might account for the underrecognition of ASD in girls. Despite the existence of different norms for boys and girls with ASD on several major screening tests, the algorithm of the Autism Diagnosis Interview‐Revised (ADI‐R) has not been reformulated. The aim of our study was to investigate which ADI‐R items discriminate between males and females, and to evaluate their weighting in the final diagnosis of autism. We then conducted discriminant analysis (DA) on a sample of 594 probands including 129 females with ASD, recruited by the Paris Autism Research International Sibpair (PARIS) Study. A replication analysis was run on an independent sample of 1716 probands including 338 females with ASD, recruited through the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange (AGRE) program. Entering the raw scores for all ADI‐R items as independent variables, the DA correctly classified 78.9% of males and 72.9% of females (\n              P\n               < 0.001) in the PARIS cohort, and 72.2% of males and 68.3% of females (\n              P\n               < 0.0001) in the AGRE cohort. Among the items extracted by the stepwise DA, four belonged to the ADI‐R algorithm used for the final diagnosis of ASD. In conclusion, several items of the ADI‐R that are taken into account in the diagnosis of autism significantly differentiates between males and females.

Through an examination of recent studies, we explore how technologies such as wearable sensors, eye-tracking systems, virtual reality environments, neuroimaging, and microbiome analysis contribute to a holistic approach to ASD diagnostics. The analysis reveals how these technologies facilitate non-invasive, real-time assessments across diverse settings, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and accessibility. The findings underscore the transformative potential of AI, IoT, and sensor-based driven tools in providing personalized and continuous ASD detection, advocating for data-driven approaches that extend beyond traditional methodologies.

In this context, an international literature review was carried out to evidence and describe the characteristics of restricted interests found in girls with autistic spectrum disorder. A documentary search was conducted on PubMed and a systematic literature review was carried out based on the PRISMA methodology. We selected studies with a population of boys and girls diagnosed as autistic according to the DSM-IV or the DSM-5, in which quantitative and descriptive comparisons of restricted interests, according to gender were carried out. Nineteen studies were found to be relevant. Fifteen enabled a refining of the characteristics of restricted interests among females: fewer restricted interests were identified in comparison with boys, and the autistic girls’ interests seem to be closer to those of neurotypical girls than to those of autistic boys, which thus led to more complex screening. Age and Intelligence quotient seem to be two factors that trigger variations in restricted interests differently according to gender. Representations among professionals also have an impact on diagnoses among girls. For future research, one of the perspectives could be a comparison between girls with autism and neurotypical girls to limit gender bias. The present results contribute to potentially extending knowledge of a female phenotypical profile in autism and show the need to improve the general population’s awareness, to improve health professionals’ training and possibly to revise the diagnostic tools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bourson","given":"Lise"},{"family":"Prevost","given":"Camille"}],"citation-key":"bourson2024","container-title":"European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1007/s00787-022-01998-5","ISSN":"1435-165X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"987-1004","source":"Springer Link","title":"Characteristics of restricted interests in girls with ASD compared to boys: a systematic review of the literature","title-short":"Characteristics of restricted interests in girls with ASD compared to boys","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-01998-5","volume":"33"},

This disorder is characterized by difﬁculties in social communication, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. It is diagnosed during the ﬁrst three years of life. Early and intensive interventions have been shown to improve the developmental trajectory of the affected children. The earlier the diagnosis, the sooner the intervention therapy can begin, thus, making early diagnosis an important research goal. Technological innovations have tremendous potential to assist with early diagnosis and improve intervention programs. The need for careful and methodological evaluation of such emerging technologies becomes important in order to assist not only the therapists and clinicians in their selection of suitable tools, but to also guide the developers of the technologies in improving hardware and software. In this paper, we survey the literatures on sensing technologies for ASD and we categorize them into eye trackers, movement trackers, electrodermal activity monitors, tactile sensors, vocal prosody and speech detectors, and sleep quality assessment devices. We assess their effectiveness and study their limitations. We also examine the challenges faced by this growing ﬁeld that need to be addressed before these technologies can perform up to their theoretical potential.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cabibihan","given":"John-John"},{"family":"Javed","given":"Hifza"},{"family":"Aldosari","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Frazier","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Elbashir","given":"Haitham"}],"citation-key":"cabibihan2016","container-title":"Sensors","container-title-short":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s17010046","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,27]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"46","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sensing Technologies for Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening and Intervention","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/1/46","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"calderoni2023","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental conditions whose shared core features are impairments in social interaction and communication as well as restricted patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. The significant and consistent male preponderance in ASD prevalence has historically affected the scientific knowledge of autism in females as regards, inter alia, the clinical presentation, the genetic architecture, and the structural brain underpinnings. Indeed, females with ASD are under-investigated as samples recruited for clinical research typically reflect the strong male bias of the disorder. In the last years, the study of the various aspects of sex/gender (s/g) differences in ASD is gaining increased clinical and research interest resulting in a growing number of investigations on this topic. Here, I review and discuss evidence emerged from epidemiological, clinical, and neuroimaging studies in the last decade focusing on s/g differences in children with ASD. These studies are the prerequisites for the development of assessment and treatment practices which take into consideration s/g differences in ASD. Ultimately, a better understanding of s/g differences aims at improving healthcare for both ASD males and females.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Calderoni","given":"Sara"}],"citation-key":"calderoni2023","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience Research","DOI":"10.1002/jnr.25000","ISSN":"1097-4547","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","page":"739-750","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Sex/gender differences in children with autism spectrum disorder: A brief overview on epidemiology, symptom profile, and neuroanatomy","title-short":"Sex/gender differences in children with autism spectrum disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.25000","volume":"101"},

However, human interactions are greatly shaped by our unique traits, and self-related factors are surprisingly little studied in the context of interpersonal motor synchrony. In this study, we investigated two such factors known to be highly associated with motor coordination: gender and autistic traits. We employed a real-world task extending our understanding beyond laboratory tasks. Participants of the same gender were paired up to walk and chat in a natural environment. A cover story was introduced so that participants would not know their walking steps were being recorded and instead believed that their location was being tracked by a global positioning system (GPS), so they would ignore the motor recording. We found that the female pairs’ steps were more synchronized than those of the males, and higher autistic tendencies (measured by the autism-spectrum quotient) attenuated synchronous steps. Those who synchronized better had higher impression rating increase for their walking partners (measured by interpersonal judgement scale) than those who synchronized less well. Our results indicated that the participants’ joint movements were shaped by predisposed traits and might share similar mechanism with social functions such as empathy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Miao"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Masaharu"},{"family":"Tseng","given":"Chia-huei"}],"citation-key":"cheng2017","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0184083","editor":[{"family":"Kret","given":"Mariska E."}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,5]]},"language":"en","page":"e0184083","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Gender and autistic traits modulate implicit motor synchrony","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184083","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"chien2023","abstract":"The design goals of recently developed serious games are to improve attention, affective recognition, and social interactions among individuals with autism. However, most previous studies on serious games used behavioral questionnaires to evaluate their effectiveness. The cognitive assessment of individuals with autism after behavioral intervention or drug treatment has become important because it provides promising biomarkers to assess improvement after cognitive intervention. In this study, we developed a game-based social interaction platform incorporating an eye-tracking system for children and preadolescents with autism. Three modules (focusing on gaze following, facial emotion recognition, and social interaction skills) are included in the platform; participants with autism learn these according to their cognitive abilities. The eye-tracking results showed decreased fixation durations when autistic children looked at positive emotional expressions and focused on multiple targets. Prolonged saccade durations and shorter fixation times for social-related facial emotion expressions were also found in preadolescents and teenagers with autism. Our findings suggest that these atypical gaze patterns are reliable biomarkers for evaluating the social and cognitive functions of autistic individuals while playing serious games. The proposed platform’s game-based modules and the findings regarding aberrant gaze patterns in autistic individuals demonstrate the possibility of evaluating cognitive functions and intervention effectiveness by using eye-tracking signals in a serious game or real-life environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Chien","given":"Yi-Ling"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Chia-Hsin"},{"family":"Chiu","given":"Yen-Nan"},{"family":"Tsai","given":"Wen-Che"},{"family":"Min","given":"Yuan-Che"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Yang-Min"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Jui-Shen"},{"family":"Tseng","given":"Yi-Li"}],"citation-key":"chien2023","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3232369","ISSN":"1558-0210","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"749-758","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Game-Based Social Interaction Platform for Cognitive Assessment of Autism Using Eye Tracking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000269","volume":"31"},
  {"id":"chua2022","abstract":"Movement is prospective. It structures self-generated engagement with objects and social partners and is fundamental to children's learning and development. In autistic children, previous reports of differences in movement kinematics compared to neurotypical peers suggest that its prospective organisation might be disrupted. Here, we employed a smart tablet serious game paradigm to assess differences in the feedforward and feedback mechanisms of prospective action organisation, between autistic and neurotypical preschool children. We analysed 3926 goal-directed finger movements made during smart-tablet ecological gameplay, from 28 children with Childhood Autism (ICD-10; ASD) and 43 neurotypical children (TD), aged 3–6 years old. Using linear and generalised linear mixed-effect models, we found the ASD group executed movements with longer movement time (MT) and time to peak velocity (TTPV), lower peak velocity (PV), with PV less likely to occur in the first movement unit (MU) and with a greater number of movement units after peak velocity (MU-APV). Interestingly, compared to the TD group, the ASD group showed smaller increases in PV, TTPV and MT with an increase in age (ASD × age interaction), together with a smaller reduction in MU-APV and an increase in MU-APV at shorter target distances (ASD × Dist interaction). Our results are the first to highlight different developmental trends in anticipatory feedforward and compensatory feedback mechanisms of control, contributing to differences in movement kinematics observed between autistic and neurotypical children. These findings point to differences in integration of prospective perceptuomotor information, with implications for embodied cognition and learning from self-generated action in autism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chua","given":"Yu Wei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Szu-Ching"},{"family":"Anzulewicz","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Sobota","given":"Krzystof"},{"family":"Tachtatzis","given":"Christos"},{"family":"Andonovic","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Rowe","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Delafield-Butt","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"chua2022","container-title":"Developmental Science","DOI":"10.1111/desc.13195","ISSN":"1467-7687","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021 The Authors.

  {"id":"cook2021","abstract":"Some autistic people employ strategies and behaviours to cope with the everyday social world, thereby ‘camouflaging’ their autistic differences and difficulties. This review aimed to systematically appraise and synthesise the current evidence base pertaining to autistic camouflaging. Following a systematic search of eight databases, 29 studies quantifying camouflaging in children and adults with autism diagnoses or high levels of autistic traits were reviewed. The multiple methods used to measure camouflaging broadly fell under two different approaches: internal-external discrepancy or self-report. These approaches appear to relate to two distinct but potentially connected elements of camouflaging: observable behavioural presentations and selfperceived camouflaging efforts. While significant variation was noted across individual study findings, much of the existing literature supported three preliminary findings about the nature of autistic camouflaging: (1) adults with more self-reported autistic traits report greater engagement in camouflaging; (2) sex and gender differences exist in camouflaging; and (3) higher self-reported camouflaging is associated with worse mental health outcomes. However, the research base was limited regarding participant characterisation and representativeness, which suggests that conclusions cannot be applied to the autistic community as a whole. We propose priorities for future research in refining the current understanding of camouflaging and improving measurement methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Hull","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Crane","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Mandy","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"cook2021","container-title":"Clinical Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Clinical Psychology Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.cpr.2021.102080","ISSN":"02727358","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","page":"102080","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Camouflaging in autism: A systematic review","title-short":"Camouflaging in autism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735821001239","volume":"89"},

First (Study 1 – Phenotypic Differences in Autism), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of gender differences in autism phenotype. The electronic datasets Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsychInfo were searched. We included 67 articles that compared females and males in autism core symptoms, and in cognitive, socioemotional, and behavioural phenotypes. Autistic males exhibited more severe symptoms and social interaction difficulties on standard clinical measures than females, who, in turn, exhibited more cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Considering the hypothesis of camouflaging possibly underlying these differences, we then conducted a meta-analysis of gender differences in camouflaging (Study 2 – Camouflaging Differences in Autism). The same datasets as the first study were searched. Ten studies were included. Females used more compensation and masking camouflage strategies than males.

A search for all peer-reviewed articles containing the words autism, age, and diagnosis in either the title or abstract was performed. A total of 42 studies published from January 1990 through March 2012 were identified. Mean age at diagnosis for all autism spectrum disorders ranged from 38 to 120 months and has decreased over time. Factors associated with earlier diagnosis included greater symptom severity, high socioeconomic status, and greater parental concern about initial symptoms. Family interactions with the health and education systems prior to diagnosis also influenced age at diagnosis. Geographic variation in age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was identified in a number of studies, suggesting that community resources and state policies play a role in early identification.

Children with autism spectrum disorder had average intelligence (IQ ⩾ 70), a confirmed diagnosis, and were educated in the general education classroom. Typically developing children were matched by sex, age, and city of residence to children with autism spectrum disorder. The results indicate that the female social landscape supports the camouflage hypothesis; girls with autism spectrum disorder used compensatory behaviors, such as staying in close proximately to peers and weaving in and out of activities, which appeared to mask their social challenges. Comparatively, the male landscape made it easier to detect the social challenges of boys with autism spectrum disorder. Typically developing boys tended to play organized games; boys with autism spectrum disorder tended to play alone. The results highlight a male bias in our perception of autism spectrum disorder. If practitioners look for social isolation on the playground when identifying children with social challenges, then our findings suggest that girls with autism spectrum disorder will continue to be left unidentified.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dean","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Harwood","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Kasari","given":"Connie"}],"citation-key":"dean2017","container-title":"Autism","container-title-short":"Autism","DOI":"10.1177/1362361316671845","ISSN":"1362-3613, 1461-7005","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8]]},"language":"en","page":"678-689","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The art of camouflage: Gender differences in the social behaviors of girls and boys with autism spectrum disorder","title-short":"The art of camouflage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1362361316671845","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"dimarco2025","abstract":"Introduction Autistic people experience mental health difficulties in higher numbers compared to neurotypical people. Within the United Kingdom, many will access psychological therapies through the National Health Service (NHS), but many autistic people report negative experiences (All Party Parliamentary Group on Autism [APPGA] 2019). This study qualitatively examines the lived experiences of autistic people in their psychological therapies. Method This research adopts a qualitative approach by using Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) to guide the research process and analysis of data. Eight autistic adults who had received treatment via the NHS were interviewed regarding their experiences of adult psychological therapies and what facilitated or hindered a positive experience. Findings Four themes were constructed: ‘doing therapy “right”’, ‘the therapeutic relationship’, ‘what's the point?’ and ‘lack of choice’. The processes between the therapist and client underpinned experiences, with a reciprocal relationship between factors impacting and being impacted by the relationship. Psychological therapies were found to foster feelings of imposition of treatment with little ability to choose one's own pathway to recovery. All participants reported a lack of psychological safety regarding their identities as autistic people and named lack of therapist knowledge of neurodiversity as a barrier. Implications Recommendations include therapeutic boundaries and explicit communication of expectations, allowing the client to be themselves and feel able to engage in practical strategies. Tracking progress is also important, alongside attending relevant training delivered by autistic individuals. Implications for policy include offering more sessions to autistic individuals to allow time for rapport building to reduce re-referrals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Marco","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"DClinPsy","given":"Phillippa Wood"},{"family":"CPsychol","given":"Nicholas Troop"}],"citation-key":"dimarco2025","container-title":"Counselling and Psychotherapy Research","DOI":"10.1002/capr.12902","ISSN":"1746-1405","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"en","page":"e12902","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"‘They Say We're the Rigid Ones’: A Reflexive Thematic Analysis of Autistic Adults' Experiences of Psychological Therapies","title-short":"‘They Say We're the Rigid Ones’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/capr.12902","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"dougherty2022","abstract":"Male sex is a strong risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The leading theory for a \"female protective effect\" (FPE) envisions males and females have \"differing thresholds\" under a \"liability threshold model\" (DT-LTM). Specifically, this model posits that females require either a greater number or larger magnitude of risk factors (i.e., greater liability) to manifest ASD, which is supported by the finding that a greater proportion of females with ASD have highly penetrant genetic mutations. Herein, we derive testable hypotheses from the DT-LTM for ASD, investigating heritability, familial recurrence, correlation between ASD penetrance and sex ratio, population traits, clinical features, the stability of the sex ratio across diagnostic changes, and highlight other key prerequisites. Our findings reveal that several key predictions of the DT-LTM are not supported by current data, requiring us to establish a different conceptual framework for evaluating alternate models that explain sex differences in ASD.","author":[{"family":"Dougherty","given":"Joseph D."},{"family":"Marrus","given":"Natasha"},{"family":"Maloney","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Yip","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Sandin","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Tychele N."},{"family":"Selmanovic","given":"Din"},{"family":"Kroll","given":"Kristen L."},{"family":"Gutmann","given":"David H."},{"family":"Constantino","given":"John N."},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Lauren A."}],"citation-key":"dougherty2022","container-title":"Neuron","container-title-short":"Neuron","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuron.2022.06.020","ISSN":"1097-4199","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,19]]},"language":"eng","page":"3243-3262","PMCID":"PMC9588569","PMID":"35868305","source":"PubMed","title":"Can the \"female protective effect\" liability threshold model explain sex differences in autism spectrum disorder?","type":"article-journal","volume":"110"},
  {"id":"duda2016","abstract":"Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) continue to rise in prevalence, together affecting >10% of today’s pediatric population, the methods of diagnosis remain subjective, cumbersome and time intensive. With gaps upward of a year between initial suspicion and diagnosis, valuable time where treatments and behavioral interventions could be applied is lost as these disorders remain undetected. Methods to quickly and accurately assess risk for these, and other, developmental disorders are necessary to streamline the process of diagnosis and provide families access to much-needed therapies sooner. Using forward feature selection, as well as undersampling and 10-fold cross-validation, we trained and tested six machine learning models on complete 65-item Social Responsiveness Scale score sheets from 2925 individuals with either ASD (n=2775) or ADHD (n=150). We found that five of the 65 behaviors measured by this screening tool were sufficient to distinguish ASD from ADHD with high accuracy (area under the curve=0.965). These results support the hypotheses that (1) machine learning can be used to discern between autism and ADHD with high accuracy and (2) this distinction can be made using a small number of commonly measured behaviors. Our findings show promise for use as an electronically administered, caregiver-directed resource for preliminary risk evaluation and/or pre-clinical screening and triage that could help to speed the diagnosis of these disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Duda","given":"M."},{"family":"Ma","given":"R."},{"family":"Haber","given":"N."},{"family":"Wall","given":"D.

Based on information from the short version of the Developmental, Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 130 children (106 boys and 24 girls) received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) criteria and 101 children (61 boys and 40 girls) did not. Higher overall levels of parent-reported repetitive and restricted behavior symptoms were less predictive of an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis in girls than in boys (odds ratio interaction = 0.41, 95% confidence interval = 0.18-0.92, p = 0.03). In contrast, higher overall levels of parent-reported emotional and behavioral problems increased the probability of an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis more in girls than in boys (odds ratio interaction = 2.44, 95% confidence interval = 1.13-5.29, p = 0.02).

Method: Data from a large population-based sample of children were examined. Girls and boys (aged 10 –12 years) meeting diagnostic criteria for an ASD were compared with those failing to meet diagnostic criteria despite very high scores on a trait measure of ASD, the Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST). Information about behavioral difﬁculties as reported by teachers, and early estimates of intellectual functioning, were compared. Results: Girls, but not boys, meeting diagnostic criteria for ASD showed signiﬁcantly more additional problems (low intellectual level, behavioral difﬁculties) than peers with similarly high CAST scores who did not meet diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: These data suggest that, in the absence of additional intellectual or behavioral problems, girls are less likely than boys to meet diagnostic criteria for ASD at equivalently high levels of autistic-like traits.

  {"id":"edwards2024","abstract":"Background Evidence that autism often manifests differently between males and females is growing, particularly in terms of social interaction and communication, but it is unclear if there are sex differences in restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests (RRBIs) when rigorously focusing on the narrow construct level (i.e., stereotyped behaviour, restricted interests, insistence on sameness, and/or sensory experiences). Methods We conducted a systematic review and four random effects meta-analyses investigating sex differences in narrow construct measures of RRBIs in autistic children, adolescents, and adults (Prospero registration ID: CRD42021254221). Study quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Results Forty-six studies were narratively synthesised and 25 of these were included in four random effects meta-analyses. Results found that autistic males had significantly higher levels of stereotyped behaviours (SMD = 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.09, 0.33], p < .001) and restricted interests (SMD = 0.18, 95% CI [0.07, 0.29], p < .001) compared to autistic females. In contrast, there were no significant sex differences for sensory experiences (SMD = −0.09, 95% CI [−0.27, 0.09], p = .32) and insistence on sameness (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI [−0.03, 0.05], p = .68). The findings from the narrative synthesis were generally consistent with those from the meta-analyses and also found qualitative sex differences in the way RRBIs manifest. Conclusions Our findings show significant differences in narrowly defined RRBIs in males and females. Practitioners need to be aware of such differences, which could be contributing to the under-recognition of autism in females and may not be captured by current diagnostic instruments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Edwards","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Sargeant","given":"Cora"},{"family":"Cortese","given":"Samuele"},{"family":"Wood-Downie","given":"Henry"}],"citation-key":"edwards2024","container-title":"Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1111/jcpp.13855","ISSN":"1469-7610","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

Early diagnosis of ASD can prevent from its severity and prolonged effects. Federated learning (FL) is one of the most recent techniques that can be applied for accurate ASD diagnoses in early stages or prevention of its long-term effects. In this article, FL technique has been uniquely applied for autism detection by training two different ML classifiers including logistic regression and support vector machine locally for classification of ASD factors and detection of ASD in children and adults. Due to FL, results obtained from these classifiers have been transmitted to central server where meta classifier is trained to determine which approach is most accurate in the detection of ASD in children and adults. Four different ASD patient datasets, each containing more than 600 records of effected children and adults have been obtained from different repository for features extraction. The proposed model predicted ASD with 98% accuracy (in children) and 81% accuracy (in adults).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Farooq","given":"Muhammad Shoaib"},{"family":"Tehseen","given":"Rabia"},{"family":"Sabir","given":"Maidah"},{"family":"Atal","given":"Zabihullah"}],"citation-key":"farooq2023","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-023-35910-1","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"language":"en","page":"9605","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and adults using machine learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35910-1","volume":"13"},

This is the first systematic review to synthesize the literature on autistic people's experiences of stigma and coping strategies. 2877 studies were screened and 27 were included in this review. The reviewed literature demonstrates that autistic individuals are acutely aware of being stereotyped, judged, and discriminated by others. Autistic people also show signs of internalizing stigma, rendering them more vulnerable to low self-worth and poorer mental health. To manage the impact of stigma, the included studies suggest that autistic individuals may use these strategies: concealment and camouflaging, selective disclosure and self-advocacy, as well as positive reframing and reconstructing identity. However, the evidence is limited and mixed in terms of how helpful and effective these strategies are.

  {"id":"hassan2024","abstract":"Nowadays, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a compound neurodevelopmental disorder that affects millions of persons universally, impacting their communication, communal interaction, and behavior. ASD is a diverse condition that exhibits differently in each individual, from trivial complications with social cues to severe challenges with parallel communication. ASD has become a demanding concern for healthcare professionals, and educationalists, highlighting the need for early detection, effective intervention, and wide-ranging support systems. As a result, an approach has proposed for predicting ASD at early stages, as the existing models have overfitting, class imbalance and more complexity problems. To overcome these issues a hybrid model of eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression (XGBoost-LR) has proposed, which involves with preprocessing of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Standard Scalar Standardization to balance class and to improve interpretability. Next, feature extraction is performed with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and cross validation using 5foldCV to reduce overfitting and improve generalizability. The XGBoost-LR model gives a precise rate in predicting and classifying the stages of ASD. The proposed XGBoost-LR model gives the better results than the other existing methods Support Vector Machine (SVM) in terms of metrices accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and f1 score respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hassan","given":"Muntather Muhsin"},{"family":"Laxmi","given":"H.

  {"id":"hu2024","abstract":"Diagnosing language disorders associated with autism is a complex challenge, often hampered by the subjective nature and variability of traditional assessment methods. Traditional diagnostic methods not only require intensive human effort but also often result in delayed interventions due to their lack of speed and precision. In this study, we explored the application of ChatGPT, a large language model, to overcome these obstacles by enhancing sensitivity and profiling linguistic features for autism diagnosis. This research utilizes ChatGPT natural language processing capabilities to simplify and improve the diagnostic process, focusing on identifying autism related language patterns. Specifically, we compared ChatGPT performance with that of conventional supervised learning models, including BERT, a model acclaimed for its effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We showed that ChatGPT substantially outperformed these models, achieving over 10% improvement in both sensitivity and positive predictive value, in a zero shot learning configuration. The findings underscore the model potential as a diagnostic tool, combining accuracy and applicability. We identified ten key features of autism associated language disorders across scenarios. Features such as echolalia, pronoun reversal, and atypical language usage play a critical role in diagnosing ASD and informing tailored treatment plans. Together, our findings advocate for adopting sophisticated AI tools like ChatGPT in clinical settings to assess and diagnose developmental disorders. Our approach promises enhanced diagnostic precision and supports personalized medicine, potentially transforming the evaluation landscape for autism and similar neurological conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Chuanbo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqi"},{"family":"Ruan","given":"Mindi"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Xiangxu"},{"family":"Deshpande","given":"Shalaka"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Lynn K."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xin"}],"citation-key":"hu2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2405.01799","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,29]]},"number":"arXiv:2405.01799","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Exploiting ChatGPT for Diagnosing Autism-Associated Language Disorders and Identifying Distinct Features","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01799"},
  {"id":"hu2024a","abstract":"Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by identifying abnormal speech patterns from examiner-patient dialogues presents significant challenges due to the subtle and diverse manifestations of speech-related symptoms in affected individuals. This study presents a comprehensive approach to identify distinctive speech patterns through the analysis of examiner-patient dialogues. Utilizing a dataset of recorded dialogues, we extracted 40 speech-related features, categorized into frequency, zero-crossing rate, energy, spectral characteristics, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and balance. These features encompass various aspects of speech such as intonation, volume, rhythm, and speech rate, reflecting the complex nature of communicative behaviors in ASD. We employed machine learning for both classification and regression tasks to analyze these speech features. The classification model aimed to differentiate between ASD and non-ASD cases, achieving an accuracy of 87.75%. Regression models were developed to predict speech pattern related variables and a composite score from all variables, facilitating a deeper understanding of the speech dynamics associated with ASD. The effectiveness of machine learning in interpreting intricate speech patterns and the high classification accuracy underscore the potential of computational methods in supporting the diagnostic processes for ASD. This approach not only aids in early detection but also contributes to personalized treatment planning by providing insights into the speech and communication profiles of individuals with ASD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Chuanbo"},{"family":"Thrasher","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqi"},{"family":"Ruan","given":"Mindi"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Xiangxu"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Lynn K"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xin"}],"citation-key":"hu2024a","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2405.05126","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"note":"ADS Bibcode: 2024arXiv240505126H","source":"NASA ADS","title":"Exploring Speech Pattern Disorders in Autism using Machine Learning","type":"article","URL":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240505126H"},

Some additional autism spectrum condition symptoms displayed different patterns of sex/gender differences in autism spectrum conditions and typically developing groups, including measures of executive function, empathising and systemising traits, internalising and externalising problems and play behaviours. Individuals with autism spectrum conditions display typical sex/gender differences in core autism spectrum condition traits, suggesting that diagnostic criteria based on these symptoms should take into account typical sex/gender differences.

Brain imaging techniques have advanced rapidly in recent years, yielding detailed structural and functional maps of the living brain. Even so, studies are often limited in sample size, and inconsistent findings emerge, one example being varying findings regarding sex differences in the size of the corpus callosum. More recently, large‐scale neuroimaging consortia such as the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis Consortium have formed, pooling together expertise, data, and resources from hundreds of institutions around the world to ensure adequate power and reproducibility. These initiatives are helping us to better understand how brain structure is affected by development, disease, and potential modulators of these effects, including sex. This review highlights some established and disputed sex differences in brain structure across the life span, as well as pitfalls related to interpreting sex differences in health and disease.

  {"id":"jensen2022","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder is an increasingly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in the world today, with an estimated 2% of the population being affected in the USA. A major complicating factor in diagnosing, treating, and understanding autism spectrum disorder is that defining the disorder is solely based on the observation of behavior. Thus, recent research has focused on identifying specific biological abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder that can provide clues to diagnosis and treatment. Biomarkers are an objective way to identify and measure biological abnormalities for diagnostic purposes as well as to measure changes resulting from treatment. This current opinion paper discusses the state of research of various biomarkers currently in development for autism spectrum disorder. The types of biomarkers identified include prenatal history, genetics, neurological including neuroimaging, neurophysiologic, and visual attention, metabolic including abnormalities in mitochondrial, folate, trans-methylation, and trans-sulfuration pathways, immune including autoantibodies and cytokine dysregulation, autonomic nervous system, and nutritional. Many of these biomarkers have promising preliminary evidence for prenatal and post-natal pre-symptomatic risk assessment, confirmation of diagnosis, subtyping, and treatment response. However, most biomarkers have not undergone validation studies and most studies do not investigate biomarkers with clinically relevant comparison groups. Although the field of biomarker research in autism spectrum disorder is promising, it appears that it is currently in the early stages of development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Amanda R."},{"family":"Lane","given":"Alison L."},{"family":"Werner","given":"Brianna A."},{"family":"McLees","given":"Sallie E."},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Tessa S."},{"family":"Frye","given":"Richard E."}],"citation-key":"jensen2022","container-title":"Molecular Diagnosis & Therapy","container-title-short":"Mol Diagn Ther","DOI":"10.1007/s40291-022-00600-7","ISSN":"1177-1062","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"483-495","PMCID":"PMC9411091","PMID":"35759118","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Modern Biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder: Future Directions","title-short":"Modern Biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9411091/","volume":"26"},

Machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) techniques have enhanced biomarker identification in neuroimaging and behavioral studies, aiding in diagnostic accuracy and early detection. This review paper examines the transformative impact of applying machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning (DL) techniques such as transfer learning and transformer architectures, in advancing ASD diagnosis. The review begins by critically assessing existing literature utilizing ML techniques like logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines in identifying biomarkers that could potentially aid in the diagnosis of ASD and differentiate between ASD and neurotypical individuals. The focus then shifts to DL models, including Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks, to evaluate their suitability for identifying complex patterns linked to ASD. Addressing limited datasets, the review examines transfer learning with pre-trained models, including VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, Inception, and Xception architectures. Additionally, using the ABIDE-I dataset, VGG19, MobileNet, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121 were applied, evaluating their performance through accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The review further considers transformer architectures, such as Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, Spatial Temporal Transformers, BolT Transformer, and Convolutional Network Transformer for capturing longrange dependencies in ASD diagnosis.

The diagnostic process is particularly complex given symptom overlap with other mental disorders and high rates of co-occurring physical and mental health concerns. The aim of this study was to conduct a data-driven selection of the most relevant diagnostic information collected from a behavior observation and an anamnestic interview in two clinical samples of children/younger adolescents and adolescents/adults with suspected ASD. Via random forests, the present study discovered patterns of symptoms in the diagnostic data of 2310 participants (46% ASD, 54% non-ASD, age range 4–72 years) using data from the combined Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview—Revised (ADI-R) and ADOS data alone. Classifiers built on reduced subsets of diagnostic features yield satisfactory sensitivity and specificity values. For adolescents/adults specificity values were lower compared to those for children/younger adolescents. The models including ADOS and ADI-R data were mainly built on ADOS items and in the adolescent/adult sample the classifier including only ADOS items performed even better than the classifier including information from both instruments. Results suggest that reduced subsets of ADOS and ADI-R items may suffice to effectively differentiate ASD from other mental disorders. The imbalance of ADOS and ADI-R items included in the models leads to the assumption that, particularly in adolescents and adults, the ADI-R may play a lesser role than current behavior observations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kamp-Becker","given":"Inge"},{"family":"Tauscher","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Wolff","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Küpper","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Poustka","given":"Luise"},{"family":"Roepke","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Roessner","given":"Veit"},{"family":"Heider","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Stroth","given":"Sanna"}],"citation-key":"kamp-becker2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Front Psychiatry","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyt.2021.727308","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,24]]},"page":"727308","PMCID":"PMC8421762","PMID":"34504449","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Is the Combination of ADOS and ADI-R Necessary to Classify ASD?

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Early Autism Evaluation (EAE) Hub system PCPs referred a consecutive sample of children to this prospective diagnostic study for blinded eye-tracking index test and follow-up expert evaluation from June 7, 2019, to September 23, 2022. Participants included 146 children (aged 14-48 months) consecutively referred by 7 EAE Hubs. Of 154 children enrolled, 146 provided usable data for at least 1 eye-tracking measure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were sensitivity and specificity of a composite eye-tracking (ie, index) test, which was a consolidated measure based on significant eye-tracking indices, compared with reference standard expert clinical autism diagnosis. Secondary outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of an integrated approach using an index test and PCP diagnosis and certainty.\nRESULTS Among 146 children (mean [SD] age, 2.6 [0.6] years; 104 [71%] male; 21 [14%] Hispanic or Latine and 96 [66%] non-Latine White; 102 [70%] with a reference standard autism diagnosis), 113 (77%) had concordant autism outcomes between the index (composite biomarker) and reference outcomes, with 77.5% sensitivity (95% CI, 68.4%-84.5%) and 77.3% specificity (95% CI, 63.0%-87.2%). When index diagnosis was based on the combination of a composite biomarker, PCP diagnosis, and diagnostic certainty, outcomes were concordant with reference standard for 114 of 127 cases (90%) with a sensitivity of 90.7% (95% CI, 83.3%-95.0%) and a specificity of 86.7% (95% CI, 70.3%-94.7%).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this prospective diagnostic study, a composite eye-tracking biomarker was associated with a best-estimate clinical diagnosis of autism, and an integrated diagnostic model including PCP diagnosis and diagnostic certainty demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity.

Boys with autism showed a preference for male play on non-pretence items, in keeping with their sex. Girls with autism engaged in more pretend play than boys with autism, suggesting that pretence is relatively more protected in females with autism.

  {"id":"kok2016","abstract":"Introduction There is limited research on Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in females. Although the empathy construct has been examined thoroughly in autism, little attention has been paid to empathy in adult women with this condition or to gender differences within the disorder. Objective Self-reported empathy in adult women with ASD was examined and compared to that of typically developed men and women as well as to men with this condition. Methods Online databases were searched for articles investigating self-reported empathy among adult women with ASD. Only six studies comparing women to men were identified. Results All studies found women with an ASD to report lower levels of empathy than typically developed women, and typically developed men, but similar levels to men with this condition. Conclusion The self-reported empathic ability of women diagnosed with ASD resembles that of their male counterparts most closely; they show a hypermasculinisation in empathy. This is particularly surprising considering the large gender difference in empathy in the general population. Discussion One of the limitations of this review is that the current diagnostic criteria for ASD are oriented towards male-specific behaviour and fail to integrate gender specific characteristics. Hence, women diagnosed with ASD are likely to be at the male end of the continuum. The suggested hypermasculinisation of women on the spectrum, as evident from this review, may therefore be exaggerated due to a selection bias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kok","given":"Francien M."},{"family":"Groen","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Becke","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Fuermaier","given":"Anselm B.

In explaining the differential rate of occurrence in males and females, biogenetic models have been proposed and studied, often to the exclusion of potential social or cultural factors that may influence different rates of diagnosis across the genders. In this theoretical paper, we consider sociocultural influences that may contribute to the differential expression of ASD in females and partially explain potential underidentification of ASD in females. Based on our synthesis of the extant literature, we propose that ASD may be underidentified in affected females without co-occurring intellectual impairment, owing to a pattern of subtle yet potentially meaningful gender differences in symptom manifestation (e.g., less unusual stereotyped and repetitive behaviors in females, increased prevalence of internalizing problems in females) and gender inequities in research on the ASD phenotype that potentially contributes to biases in assessment tools and diagnostic practices.

  {"id":"lai2011","abstract":"Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) affect more males than females in the general population. However, within ASC it is unclear if there are phenotypic sex differences. Testing for similarities and differences between the sexes is important not only for clinical assessment but also has implications for theories of typical sex differences and of autism. Using cognitive and behavioral measures, we investigated similarities and differences between the sexes in age- and IQ-matched adults with ASC (high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome). Of the 83 (45 males and 38 females) participants, 62 (33 males and 29 females) met Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) cut-off criteria for autism in childhood and were included in all subsequent analyses. The severity of childhood core autism symptoms did not differ between the sexes. Males and females also did not differ in self-reported empathy, systemizing, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive traits/symptoms or mentalizing performance. However, adult females with ASC showed more lifetime sensory symptoms (p = 0.036), fewer current socio-communication difficulties (p = 0.001), and more self-reported autistic traits (p = 0.012) than males. In addition, females with ASC who also had developmental language delay had lower current performance IQ than those without developmental language delay (p,0.001), a pattern not seen in males. The absence of typical sex differences in empathizing-systemizing profiles within the autism spectrum confirms a prediction from the extreme male brain theory. Behavioral sex differences within ASC may also reflect different developmental mechanisms between males and females with ASC. We discuss the importance of the superficially better socio-communication ability in adult females with ASC in terms of why females with ASC may more often go under-recognized, and receive their diagnosis later, than males.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Lai","given":"Meng-Chuan"},{"family":"Lombardo","given":"Michael V."},{"family":"Pasco","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Ruigrok","given":"Amber N.

Using data from 60 age- and IQ-matched men and women with autism (without intellectual disability), we operationalized camouflaging in adults with autism for the first time as the quantitative discrepancy between the person's 'external' behavioural presentation in social-interpersonal contexts (measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) and the person's 'internal' status (dispositional traits measured by the Autism Spectrum Quotient and social cognitive capability measured by the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' Test). We found that the operationalized camouflaging measure was not significantly correlated with age or IQ. On average, women with autism had higher camouflaging scores than men with autism (Cohen's d = 0.98), with substantial variability in both groups. Greater camouflaging was associated with more depressive symptoms in men and better signal-detection sensitivity in women with autism. The neuroanatomical association with camouflaging score was largely sex/gender-dependent and significant only in women: from reverse inference, the most correlated cognitive terms were about emotion and memory.

Regarding behavioural presentation, measurement invariance across sex/gender was found in several standard measures. On this basis, diagnosed females overall showed lower restricted/repetitive behaviour/interests/activities (RRBI) than males, with small and variable effects depending on age, developmental level and kinds of RRBI. Differences insufficiently captured by standard measures may include autistic females displaying female-gender-typical narrow interests, higher social attention, linguistic abilities, motivation for friendship and more camouflaging than autistic males. Regarding developmental change, diagnosed young girls were more likely to have better cognitive development, less intense autistic symptoms and reduction of symptoms over time. Difficulties in adaptive functioning and social challenges, however, may emerge more for females in adolescence. Regarding diagnosis, general expectancy biases and gender-stereotypes may impede timely recognition of autism in females.\n          Summary \n          Appreciating the multilevel sex and gender impacts on presentation, development, and diagnosis is key to sex-equitable and gender-equitable care for autistic individuals.

  {"id":"lau2019","abstract":"The gold standard for clinical assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) relies on assessing behavior via semi-structured play-based interviews and parent interviews. Although these methods show good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ASD cases, behavioral assessments alone may hinder the identification of asymptomatic at-risk group. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) could be an appropriate approach to produce objective neural markers to supplement behavioral assessments due to its non-invasive and task-free nature. Previous neuroimaging studies reported inconsistent resting-state abnormalities in ASD, which may be explained by small sample sizes and phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD subjects, and/or the use of different analytical methods across studies. The current study aims to investigate the local resting-state abnormalities of ASD regardless of subject age, IQ, gender, disease severity and methodological differences, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). MEDLINE/PubMed databases were searched for whole-brain rs-fMRI studies on ASD published until Feb 2018. Eight experiments involving 424 subjects were included in the ALE meta-analysis. We demonstrate two ASD-related resting-state findings: local underconnectivity in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and in the right medial paracentral lobule.

In this paper, we argue that all autism intervention stakeholders need to understand and actively engage with the views of autistic people and with neurodiversity as a concept and movement. In so doing, intervention researchers and practitioners are required to move away from a normative agenda and pay diligence to environmental goodness-of-fit, autistic developmental trajectories, internal drivers and experiences, and autistic prioritized intervention targets. Autism intervention researchers must respond to these debates by reframing effectiveness, developing tools to measure autistic prioritized outcomes, and forming partnerships with autistic people. There is a pressing need for increased reflection and articulation around how intervention practices align with a neurodiversity framework and greater emphasis within intervention programmes on natural developmental processes, coping strategies, autonomy, and well-being.","author":[{"family":"Leadbitter","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Buckle","given":"Karen Leneh"},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Ceri"},{"family":"Dekker","given":"Martijn"}],"citation-key":"leadbitter2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635690","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"635690","PMCID":"PMC8075160","PMID":"33912110","source":"PubMed","title":"Autistic Self-Advocacy and the Neurodiversity Movement: Implications for Autism Early Intervention Research and Practice","title-short":"Autistic Self-Advocacy and the Neurodiversity Movement","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"lee2022","abstract":"Background: Physical activity (PA) has an impact on physical and mental health in neurotypical populations, and addressing these variables may improve the prevalent burden of anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Gamified mobile apps using behavior change techniques present a promising way of increasing PA and reducing sedentary time, thus reducing anxiety in adults with ASD.\nObjective: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a gamified and behavior change technique–based mobile app, PuzzleWalk, versus a commercially available app, Google Fit, on increasing PA and reducing sedentary time as an adjunct anxiety treatment for this population.\nMethods: A total of 24 adults with ASD were assigned to either the PuzzleWalk or Google Fit group for 5 weeks using a covariate-adaptive randomization design. PA and anxiety were assessed over 7 days at 3 different data collection periods (ie, baseline, intervention start, and intervention end) using triaxial accelerometers and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Group differences in outcome variables were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI.\nResults: The findings indicated that the PuzzleWalk group spent a significantly longer amount of time on app use compared with the Google Fit group (F2,38=5.07; P=.01; partial η2=0.21), whereas anxiety was unfavorably associated with increases in light PA and decreases in sedentary time after intervention (all P&lt;.05).\nConclusions: Further research is needed to clarify the determinants of physical and mental health and their interrelationship in adults with ASD to identify the factors that facilitate the use and adoption of mobile health technologies in these individuals. Despite these mixed results, the small changes in PA or anxiety may be clinically significant for adults with ASD.\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05466617; https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05466617","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Daehyoung"},{"family":"Frey","given":"Georgia C."},{"family":"Cothran","given":"Donetta J."},{"family":"Harezlak","given":"Jaroslaw"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Patrick C."}],"citation-key":"lee2022","container-title":"JMIR Formative Research","DOI":"10.2196/35701","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,28]]},"language":"EN","license":"Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (\"first published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research...\") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of female adults diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition in middle to late adulthood. Eleven autistic females diagnosed over the age of 40 years completed semi-structured interviews, analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Four superordinate themes emerged: A hidden condition (pretending to be normal and fitting in; mental health and mislabelling), The process of acceptance (initial reactions and search for understanding; re-living life through a new lens), The impact of others post-diagnosis (initial reactions; stereotyped assumptions), and A new identity on the autism spectrum (negotiating relationships, connections and community; changing well-being and views of the self; the meaning of diagnosis). Findings highlight several factors not previously identified that affect late diagnosis in females, including widespread limited understandings of others. Diagnosis was experienced by several participants as facilitating transition from being self-critical to self-compassionate, coupled with an increased sense of agency. Participants experienced a change in identity that enabled greater acceptance and understanding of the self. However, this was painful to adjust to at such a late stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Leedham","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Andrew R"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Freeth","given":"Megan"}],"citation-key":"leedham2020","container-title":"Autism","container-title-short":"Autism","DOI":"10.1177/1362361319853442","ISSN":"1362-3613","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"135-146","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"‘I was exhausted trying to figure it out’: The experiences of females receiving an autism diagnosis in middle to late adulthood","title-short":"‘I was exhausted trying to figure it out’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361319853442","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"liu2017","abstract":"The rapid development of computer and robotic technologies in the last decade is giving hope to perform earlier and more accurate diagnoses of the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and more effective, consistent, and cost-conscious treatment. Besides the reduced cost, the main benefit of using technology to facilitate treatment is that stimuli produced during each session of the treatment can be controlled, which not only guarantees consistency across different sessions, but also makes it possible to focus on a single phenomenon, which is difficult even for a trained professional to perform, and deliver the stimuli according to the treatment plan. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of research on recent technology-facilitated diagnosis and treat of children and adults with ASD. Different from existing reviews on this topic, which predominantly concern clinical issues, we focus on the engineering perspective of autism studies. All technology facilitated systems used for autism studies can be modeled as human machine interactive systems where one or more participants would constitute as the human component, and a computer-based or a robotic-based system would be the machine component. Based on this model, we organize our review with the following questions: (1) What are presented to the participants in the studies and how are the content and delivery methods enabled by technologies? (2) How are the reactions/inputs collected from the participants in response to the stimuli in the studies? (3) Are the experimental procedure and programs presented to participants dynamically adjustable based on the responses from the participants, and if so, how? and (4) How are the programs assessed?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiongyi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wenbing"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xiong"}],"citation-key":"liu2017","container-title":"Applied Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/app7101051","ISSN":"2076-3417","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"10","page":"1051","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Technology-Facilitated Diagnosis and Treatment of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Engineering Perspective","title-short":"Technology-Facilitated Diagnosis and Treatment of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/7/10/1051","volume":"7"},

We present a prospective study on 44 infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder compared with 127 infants later identified as typically developing who were followed longitudinally with day-long recordings from 0 to 13 months. Eight 5-min segments from each of their recordings were coded for canonical and noncanonical syllables. The results confirmed many reports that canonical babbling is a robust feature of human vocal development in the first year of life, with small overall mean differences in canonical babbling rates between the autism spectrum disorder and typically developing groups beginning around 9 months, primarily in males.

  {"id":"loomes2017","abstract":"Method: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched, and study quality was rated using a riskof-bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used. The pooled outcome measurement was the male-to-female odds ratio (MFOR), namely the odds of being male in the group with ASD compared with the non-ASD group. In effect, this is the ASD male-to-female ratio, controlling for the male-to-female ratio among participants without ASD. Results: Fifty-four studies were analyzed, with 13,784,284 participants, of whom 53,712 had ASD (43,972 boys and 9,740 girls). The overall pooled MFOR was 4.20 (95% CI 3.84–4.60), but there was very substantial between-study variability (I2 ¼ 90.9%). High-quality studies had a lower MFOR (3.32; 95% CI 2.88–3.84). Studies that screened the general population to identify participants regardless of whether they already had an ASD diagnosis showed a lower MFOR (3.25; 95% CI 2.93–3.62) than studies that only ascertained participants with a preexisting ASD diagnosis (MFOR 4.56; 95% CI 4.10–5.07). Conclusion: Of children meeting criteria for ASD, the true male-to-female ratio is not 4:1, as is often assumed; rather, it is closer to 3:1. There appears to be a diagnostic gender bias, meaning that girls who meet criteria for ASD are at disproportionate risk of not receiving a clinical diagnosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Loomes","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Hull","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Mandy","given":"William Polmear Locke"}],"citation-key":"loomes2017","container-title":"Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.jaac.2017.03.013","ISSN":"08908567","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6]]},"language":"en","page":"466-474","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What Is the Male-to-Female Ratio in Autism Spectrum Disorder?

The outlook for many individuals with autism spectrum disorder today is brighter than it was 50 years ago; more people with the condition are able to speak, read, and live in the community rather than in institutions, and some will be largely free from symptoms of the disorder by adulthood. Nevertheless, most individuals will not work full-time or live independently. Genetics and neuroscience have identified intriguing patterns of risk, but without much practical benefit yet. Considerable work is still needed to understand how and when behavioural and medical treatments can be effective, and for which children, including those with substantial comorbidities. It is also important to implement what we already know and develop services for adults with autism spectrum disorder. Clinicians can make a difference by providing timely and individualised help to families navigating referrals and access to community support systems, by providing accurate information despite often unfiltered media input, and by anticipating transitions such as family changes and school entry and leaving.","author":[{"family":"Lord","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Elsabbagh","given":"Mayada"},{"family":"Baird","given":"Gillian"},{"family":"Veenstra-Vanderweele","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"lord2018","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31129-2","ISSN":"1474-547X","issue":"10146","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,11]]},"language":"eng","page":"508-520","PMCID":"PMC7398158","PMID":"30078460","source":"PubMed","title":"Autism spectrum disorder","type":"article-journal","volume":"392"},

  {"id":"mao2024","abstract":"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents distinct diagnostic and treatment challenges, particularly in understanding gender differences in symptom presentation and intervention effectiveness. The male-to-female ASD diagnosis ratio, often cited as 4:1, is increasingly questioned due to the subtler symptom presentation in females, contributing to significant underdiagnosis. This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines to analyze data from 47 studies, examining gender differences in ASD diagnosis, symptom expression, and intervention effectiveness. Females with ASD more frequently exhibit internalizing symptoms like anxiety, social withdrawal, and emotional regulation difficulties, in contrast to the externalized behaviors typical of males. Analysis of over 1,000 individuals reveals that 75 % of males exhibit hallmark traits like repetitive behaviors and speech delays, compared to only 40 % of females. Conversely, over 60 % of females demonstrate social camouflaging behaviors, masking their symptoms and complicating their diagnosis. Additionally, this research investigates gender differences in response to intervention, finding that while 70 % of males benefit from traditional interventions like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), only 45 % of females show comparable progress. Females with ASD benefit more from therapies that focus on emotional regulation, social communication, and adaptive behaviors, underscoring the need for gender-sensitive approaches. Based on these findings, the study advocates for the development of diagnostic tools that account for gender-specific ASD traits, urging healthcare professionals to be more vigilant in identifying subtler ASD symptoms in females. Furthermore, intervention programs should be restructured to integrate social and emotional components that address the unique profiles of females with ASD. Families and caregivers must also be educated to recognize these gender-based differences, enabling earlier identification and more personalized care. Addressing these diagnostic and intervention disparities will significantly improve long-term outcomes for females with ASD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Mao","given":"Haoran"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Lulu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fang"}],"citation-key":"mao2024","container-title":"Gender and Sustainability in the Global South","DOI":"10.1515/gsgs-2024-0007","ISSN":"2942-4402","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,1]]},"language":"en","license":"De Gruyter expressly reserves the right to use all content for commercial text and data mining within the meaning of Section 44b of the German Copyright Act.","page":"92-136","publisher":"De Gruyter","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Gender Differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review of Diagnosis, Intervention, and Outcomes","title-short":"Gender Differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/gsgs-2024-0007/html","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"mcquaid2022","abstract":"Camouflaging in autism spectrum disorder refers to behaviors and/or strategies that mask the presentation of autism spectrum disorder features in social contexts in order to appear \"non-autistic\" (Attwood, 2007). Camouflaging modifies the behavioral presentation of core autism spectrum disorder features (e.g. social and communication differences), but the underlying autistic profile is unaffected, yielding a mismatch between external observable features and the internal lived experience of autism. Camouflaging could be an important factor in later diagnosis of individuals without co-occurring intellectual disability, especially among those designated female sex at birth. Little research to date has examined how gender identity impacts camouflaging, however. Furthermore, no study has compared groups that differ in diagnostic timing to directly investigate if later-diagnosed individuals show elevated camouflaging relative to those receiving an earlier diagnosis. We used the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire subscales (Assimilation, Compensation, and Masking) and investigated the roles of sex, gender identity (gender diverse vs cisgender), and diagnostic timing (childhood/adolescent-diagnosed vs adult-diagnosed), and the interactions of these factors, in autistic adults (N = 502; ages 18-49 years). Main effects of sex, gender identity, and diagnostic timing were revealed. Autistic females reported more camouflaging across all three Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire subscales compared to males. Gender diverse adults reported elevated camouflaging on the Compensation subscale compared to cisgender adults. Adulthood-diagnosed individuals reported elevated Assimilation and Compensation compared to childhood/adolescence-diagnosed individuals. We discuss how the aspects of camouflaging may have unique implications for later diagnostic timing and for the intersection of neurodiversity and gender diversity.","author":[{"family":"McQuaid","given":"Goldie A."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Nancy Raitano"},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Gregory L."}],"citation-key":"mcquaid2022","container-title":"Autism: The International Journal of Research and Practice","container-title-short":"Autism","DOI":"10.1177/13623613211042131","ISSN":"1461-7005","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"552-559","PMID":"34420418","source":"PubMed","title":"Camouflaging in autism spectrum disorder: Examining the roles of sex, gender identity, and diagnostic timing","title-short":"Camouflaging in autism spectrum disorder","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"millar2019","abstract":"Introduction Recent evidence suggests an underlying movement disruption may be a core component of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a new, accessible early biomarker. Mobile smart technologies such as iPads contain inertial movement and touch screen sensors capable of recording subsecond movement patterns during gameplay. A previous pilot study employed machine learning analysis of motor patterns recorded from children 3–5 years old. It identified those with ASD from agematched and gender-matched controls with 93% accuracy, presenting an attractive assessment method suitable for use in the home, clinic or classroom. Methods and analysis This is a phase III prospective, diagnostic classification study designed according to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies guidelines. Three cohorts are investigated: children typically developing (TD); children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD and children with a diagnosis of another neurodevelopmental disorder (OND) that is not ASD. The study will be completed in Glasgow, UK and Gothenburg, Sweden. The recruitment target is 760 children (280 TD, 280 ASD and 200 OND). Children play two games on the iPad then a third party data acquisition and analysis algorithm (Play.Care, Harimata) will classify the data as positively or negatively associated with ASD. The results are blind until data collection is complete, when the algorithm’s classification will be compared against medical diagnosis. Furthermore, parents of participants in the ASD and OND groups will complete three questionnaires: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations Questionnaire and the Adaptive Behavioural Assessment System-3 or Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II. The primary outcome measure is sensitivity and specificity of Play.Care to differentiate ASD children from TD children. Secondary outcomes measures include the accuracy of Play.Care to differentiate ASD children from OND children. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service Committee 3 and the University of Strathclyde Ethics Committee.

  {"id":"milner2024","abstract":"It is frequently reported that females are likely to receive an autism diagnosis at a later age than their male counterparts, despite similar levels of autistic traits. It has been suggested that this delay in diagnosis may in part reflect the propensity of females, more than males, to engage in camouflaging behaviors that reduce the appearance of autism-related traits. This article presents two studies which examined the relationship between gender/sex, camouflaging, and age at diagnosis in two samples of (cis-gender) autistic adults. Study 1 included data from three online samples including 242 autistic men and 570 autistic women aged 18-75 years. Study 2 included data from a longitudinal population-based sample including 24 autistic men and 35 autistic women aged 20-24 years. Camouflaging was measured with the self-report Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q). Overall, the results showed that, on average, females were diagnosed later than males. There was a stronger relationship between camouflaging and age at autism diagnosis (AaD) for females, compared with males. Within sample one, there was a significant camouflaging-by-sex interaction; high-camouflaging females had a later AaD. The role of autistic traits and changes in attitudes towards female autism and camouflaging need further exploration. These findings highlight the need for greater clinician and key stakeholder awareness and understanding of camouflaging behavior, particularly for females, during the diagnostic process.","author":[{"family":"Milner","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Colvert","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Hull","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Cook","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Dorota"},{"family":"Mandy","given":"William"},{"family":"Happé","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"milner2024","container-title":"Autism Research: Official Journal of the International Society for Autism Research","container-title-short":"Autism Res","DOI":"10.1002/aur.3059","ISSN":"1939-3806","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"626-636","PMID":"38031639","source":"PubMed","title":"Does camouflaging predict age at autism diagnosis?

There is a significantly biased ‘male lens’ in this field with autistic females insufficiently understood. We therefore conducted a systematic review to examine how sex and gender modulate brain structure and function in autistic individuals. Findings from the past 20 years are yet to converge on specific brain regions/networks with consistent sex/gender-modulating effects. Despite at least three well-powered studies identifying specific patterns of significant sex/gender-modulation of autism-control differences, many other studies are likely underpowered, suggesting a critical need for future investigation into sex/gender-based heterogeneity with better-powered designs. Future research should also formally investigate the effects of gender, beyond biological sex, which is mostly absent in the current literature. Understanding the roles of sex and gender in the development of autism is an imperative step to extend beyond the ‘male lens’ in this field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mo","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Sadoway","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Bonato","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Ameis","given":"Stephanie H."},{"family":"Anagnostou","given":"Evdokia"},{"family":"Lerch","given":"Jason P."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Margot J."},{"family":"Lai","given":"Meng-Chuan"}],"citation-key":"mo2021","container-title":"NeuroImage: Clinical","container-title-short":"NeuroImage: Clinical","DOI":"10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102811","ISSN":"2213-1582","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"102811","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"[NOTE RELEVANT] Sex/gender differences in the human autistic brains: A systematic review of 20 years of neuroimaging research","title-short":"Sex/gender differences in the human autistic brains","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158221002552","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"mohammadianrad2018","abstract":"Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with atypical movements, of which stereotypical motor movements (SMMs) interfere with learning and social interaction. The automatic SMM detection using inertial measurement units (IMU) remains complex due to the strong intra and inter-subject variability, especially when handcrafted features are extracted from the signal. We propose a new application of the deep learning to facilitate automatic SMM detection using multi-axis IMUs. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a discriminative feature space from raw data. We show how the CNN can be used for parameter transfer learning to enhance the detection rate on longitudinal data. We also combine the long short-term memory (LSTM) with CNN to model the temporal patterns in a sequence of multiaxis signals. Further, we employ ensemble learning to combine multiple LSTM learners into a more robust SMM detector. Our results show that: (1) feature learning outperforms handcrafted features; (2) parameter transfer learning is beneﬁcial in longitudinal settings; (3) using LSTM to learn the temporal dynamic of signals enhances the detection rate especially for skewed training data; (4) an ensemble of LSTMs provides more accurate and stable detectors.

While most research published between 2015 and 2019 included both male and female subjects, studies focusing exclusively on male subjects were more prevalent than those studying only female subjects. An increasing number of papers dedicated specifically to female subjects indicates a growing momentum in exploring how autism manifests in women and girls—if this trend continues, it could help narrow the existing research gap. Our analysis also reveals that the majority of research articles related to autism are authored by women, who are also more likely to include both male and female subjects, as well as female-only subjects in their studies. Moreover, women show a greater inclination to report the sex distribution of their study samples.

The purpose of this systematic review is to identify and characterise potentially scalable digital tools for direct assessment of autism spectrum disorder risk in early childhood. In total, 51,953 titles, 6884 abstracts and 567 full-text articles from four databases were screened using predefined criteria. Of these, 38 met inclusion criteria. Tasks are presented on both portable and non-portable technologies, typically by researchers in laboratory or clinic settings. Gamified tasks, virtual-reality platforms and automated analysis of video or audio recordings of children’s behaviours and speech are used to assess autism spectrum disorder risk. Tasks tapping social communication/interaction and motor domains most reliably discriminate between autism spectrum disorder and typically developing groups. Digital tools employing objective data collection and analysis methods hold immense potential for early identification of autism spectrum disorder risk. Next steps should be to further validate these tools, evaluate their generalisability outside laboratory or clinic settings, and standardise derived measures across tasks. Furthermore, stakeholders from underserved communities should be involved in the research and development process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Debarati"},{"family":"Bhavnani","given":"Supriya"},{"family":"Lockwood Estrin","given":"Georgia"},{"family":"Rao","given":"Vaisnavi"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Jayashree"},{"family":"Irfan","given":"Hiba"},{"family":"Chakrabarti","given":"Bhismadev"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Vikram"},{"family":"Belmonte","given":"Matthew K"}],"citation-key":"mukherjee2024","container-title":"Autism","container-title-short":"Autism","DOI":"10.1177/13623613221133176","ISSN":"1362-3613","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"page":"6-31","PMCID":"PMC10771029","PMID":"36336996","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Digital tools for direct assessment of autism risk during early childhood: A systematic review","title-short":"Digital tools for direct assessment of autism risk during early childhood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10771029/","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"murphy2016","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by pervasive difficulties since early childhood across reciprocal social communication and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviors. Although early ASD research focused primarily on children, there is increasing recognition that ASD is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder. However, although health and education services for children with ASD are relatively well established, service provision for adults with ASD is in its infancy. There is a lack of health services research for adults with ASD, including identification of comorbid health difficulties, rigorous treatment trials (pharmacological and psychological), development of new pharmacotherapies, investigation of transition and aging across the lifespan, and consideration of sex differences and the views of people with ASD. This article reviews available evidence regarding the etiology, legislation, diagnosis, management, and service provision for adults with ASD and considers what is needed to support adults with ASD as they age. We conclude that health services research for adults with ASD is urgently warranted. In particular, research is required to better understand the needs of adults with ASD, including health, aging, service development, transition, treatment options across the lifespan, sex, and the views of people with ASD. Additionally, the outcomes of recent international legislative efforts to raise awareness of ASD and service provision for adults with ASD are to be determined. Future research is required to identify high-quality, evidence-based, and cost-effective models of care. Furthermore, future health services research is also required at the beginning and end of adulthood, including improved transition from youth to adult health care and increased understanding of aging and health in older adults with ASD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Murphy","given":"Clodagh M"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"C Ellie"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"Dene M"},{"family":"Ecker","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Daly","given":"Eileen M"},{"family":"Hammond","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Galanopoulos","given":"Anastasios"},{"family":"Dud","given":"Iulia"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Declan G"},{"family":"McAlonan","given":"Grainne M"}],"citation-key":"murphy2016","container-title":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","container-title-short":"Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat","DOI":"10.2147/NDT.S65455","ISSN":"1176-6328","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,7]]},"page":"1669-1686","PMCID":"PMC4940003","PMID":"27462160","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Autism spectrum disorder in adults: diagnosis, management, and health services development","title-short":"Autism spectrum disorder in adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4940003/","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"nasrallah","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are neurodevelopmental disorders known to severely affect social and cognitive functions. ASD can be diagnosed at a very early age, and is often characterized by social communication impairments, repetitive behaviors and severely restricted interests. On the other hand, ADHD is predominantly characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and, in some cases, hyperactivity. Research over the past few years has shown that the majority of individuals with ASD frequently present with comorbid ADHD. Current treatment modalities for these disorders can include behavioral therapy, pharmacological medications and supportive interventions. However, these treatment strategies are not always effective and may fail in offering significant improvements in the quality of life and functioning of affected individuals. Recently, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great potential in extending the current clinical boundaries in ASD and ADHD by aiding physicians in the detection and treatment of these disorders. A better understanding of this technology and its applications in neurodevelopmental disorders could pave the way for the development of novel and more effective diagnostic and therapeutic methods. This review paper provides the current state of knowledge regarding the link between ASD and ADHD and provide a comprehensive overview of the growing role of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Nasrallah","given":"Maissane"},{"family":"El Moghrabi","given":"Alaa"},{"family":"Kayal","given":"Marylouise"},{"family":"Matar","given":"Dina"},{"family":"Alwan","given":"Iman"},{"family":"Fakhouy","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"nasrallah","container-title":"International Journal of Developmental Disabilities","DOI":"10.1080/20473869.2025.2456800","ISSN":"2047-3869","issue":"0","page":"1-14","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The emerging role of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20473869.2025.2456800","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"natoli2023","abstract":"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with more males than females diagnosed, and researchers have considered whether the existence of a female-specific ASD phenotype may contribute to differences in rates of diagnosis. We sought to inform this issue through a systematic review and meta-analysis of potential sex differences specifically in young autistic children across a range of domains including core ASD features, social functioning, cognition, and co-occurring internalising and/or externalising conditions. The systematic review identified 35 studies examining sex differences in young autistic children. Conflicting results were evident across studies, with some reporting small sex differences and others reporting no sex differences. Meta-analysis revealed no overarching significant sex differences in the domains investigated. However, the meta-analytic effect for the RRB domain approached significance, with females demonstrating fewer RRBs than males. Many of the primary studies included here utilised data from standardised diagnostic instruments to measure autism features, so while this study suggests non-significant sex differences in early childhood ASD, it remains possible that current tools are insufficiently sensitive to detect differences in ASD presentation by sex at this age. It is also possible that the diagnostic criteria may reflect a predominately ‘male phenotype’ and this may obscure the detection of genuine sex differences in young autistic children.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Natoli","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Bent","given":"Catherine A."},{"family":"Luu","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Hudry","given":"Kristelle"}],"citation-key":"natoli2023","container-title":"Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders","container-title-short":"Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.rasd.2023.102207","ISSN":"17509467","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"102207","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"No sex differences in core autism features, social functioning, cognition or co-occurring conditions in young autistic children: A systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"No sex differences in core autism features, social functioning, cognition or co-occurring conditions in young autistic children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1750946723001071","volume":"107"},
  {"id":"neo2023","abstract":"Narrative reviews have described various resting-state EEG power differences in autism across all five canonical frequency bands, with increased power for low and high frequencies and reduced power for middle frequencies. However, these differences have yet to be quantified using effect sizes and probed robustly for consistency, which are critical next steps for clinical translation. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of published and gray literature on resting-state EEG power in autism. We performed 10 meta-analyses to synthesize and quantify differences in absolute and relative resting-state delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma EEG power in autism. We also conducted moderator analyses to determine whether demographic characteristics, methodological details, and risk-of-bias indicators might account for heterogeneous study effect sizes. Our literature search and study selection processes yielded 41 studies involving 1,246 autistic and 1,455 neurotypical individuals. Meta-analytic models of 135 effect sizes demonstrated that autistic individuals exhibited reduced relative alpha (g = −0.35) and increased gamma (absolute: g = 0.37, relative: g = 1.06) power, but similar delta (absolute: g = 0.06, relative: g = 0.10), theta (absolute: g = −0.03, relative: g = −0.15), absolute alpha (g = −0.17), and beta (absolute: g = 0.01, relative: g = 0.08) power. Substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes was observed across all absolute (I2: 36.1–81.9%) and relative (I2: 64.6–84.4%) frequency bands. Moderator analyses revealed that age, biological sex, IQ, referencing scheme, epoch duration, and use of gold-standard autism diagnostic instruments did not moderate study effect sizes. In contrast, resting-state paradigm type (eyes-closed versus eyes-open) moderated absolute beta, relative delta, and relative alpha power effect sizes, and resting-state recording duration moderated relative alpha power effect sizes. These findings support further investigation of resting-state alpha and gamma power as potential biomarkers for autism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Neo","given":"Wei Siong"},{"family":"Foti","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Keehn","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Kelleher","given":"Bridgette"}],"citation-key":"neo2023","container-title":"Translational Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Transl Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1038/s41398-023-02681-2","ISSN":"2158-3188","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","page":"1-14","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"[NOT RELEVANT] Resting-state EEG power differences in autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Resting-state EEG power differences in autism spectrum disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-023-02681-2","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"perochon2023","abstract":"Early detection of autism, a neurodevelopmental condition associated with challenges in social communication, ensures timely access to intervention. Autism screening questionnaires have been shown to have lower accuracy when used in real-world settings, such as primary care, as compared to research studies, particularly for children of color and girls. Here we report findings from a multiclinic, prospective study assessing the accuracy of an autism screening digital application (app) administered during a pediatric well-child visit to 475 (17–36 months old) children (269 boys and 206 girls), of which 49 were diagnosed with autism and 98 were diagnosed with developmental delay without autism. The app displayed stimuli that elicited behavioral signs of autism, quantified using computer vision and machine learning. An algorithm combining multiple digital phenotypes showed high diagnostic accuracy with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.90, sensitivity = 87.8%, specificity = 80.8%, negative predictive value = 97.8% and positive predictive value = 40.6%. The algorithm had similar sensitivity performance across subgroups as defined by sex, race and ethnicity. These results demonstrate the potential for digital phenotyping to provide an objective, scalable approach to autism screening in real-world settings. Moreover, combining results from digital phenotyping and caregiver questionnaires may increase autism screening accuracy and help reduce disparities in access to diagnosis and intervention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Perochon","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Di Martino","given":"J.

Two hundred and twenty-three autistic adults completed an online survey measuring perceived autism-related stigma, individualistic and collective strategies, camouflaging and mental wellbeing. Results indicated that higher camouflaging was positively associated with autism-related stigma and both individualistic and collective strategy use. Autism-related stigma was associated with lower wellbeing however this relationship was not mediated by camouflaging.

  {"id":"ponzo2023","abstract":"Background: Diagnostic delays in autism are common, with the time to diagnosis being up to 3 years from the onset of symptoms. Such delays have a proven detrimental effect on individuals and families going through the process. Digital health products, such as mobile apps, can help close this gap due to their scalability and ease of access. Further, mobile apps offer the opportunity to make the diagnostic process faster and more accurate by providing additional and timely information to clinicians undergoing autism assessments.\nObjective: The aim of this scoping review was to synthesize the available evidence about digital biomarker tools to aid clinicians, researchers in the autism field, and end users in making decisions as to their adoption within clinical and research settings.\nMethods: We conducted a structured literature search on databases and search engines to identify peer-reviewed studies and regulatory submissions that describe app characteristics, validation study details, and accuracy and validity metrics of commercial and research digital biomarker apps aimed at aiding the diagnosis of autism.\nResults: We identified 4 studies evaluating 4 products: 1 commercial and 3 research apps. The accuracy of the identified apps varied between 28% and 80.6%. Sensitivity and specificity also varied, ranging from 51.6% to 81.6% and 18.5% to 80.5%, respectively. Positive predictive value ranged from 20.3% to 76.6%, and negative predictive value fluctuated between 48.7% and 97.4%. Further, we found a lack of details around participants’ demographics and, where these were reported, important imbalances in sex and ethnicity in the studies evaluating such products. Finally, evaluation methods as well as accuracy and validity metrics of available tools were not clearly reported in some cases and varied greatly across studies. Different comparators were also used, with some studies validating their tools against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria and others through self-reported measures. Further, while in most cases, 2 classes were used for algorithm validation purposes, 1 of the studies reported a third category (indeterminate). These discrepancies substantially impact the comparability and generalizability of the results, thus highlighting the need for standardized validation processes and the reporting of findings.\nConclusions: Despite their popularity, systematic evaluations and syntheses of the current state of the art of digital health products are lacking. Standardized and transparent evaluations of digital health tools in diverse populations are needed to assess their real-world usability and validity, as well as help researchers, clinicians, and end users safely adopt novel tools within clinical and research practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ponzo","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"May","given":"Merle"},{"family":"Tamayo-Elizalde","given":"Miren"},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Kerri"},{"family":"Shand","given":"Alanna J."},{"family":"Bamford","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Multmeier","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Griessel","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Szulyovszky","given":"Benedek"},{"family":"Blakey","given":"William"},{"family":"Valentine","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Plans","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"ponzo2023","container-title":"JMIR mHealth and uHealth","DOI":"10.2196/52377","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,17]]},"language":"EN","license":"Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (\"first published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth...\") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

Some of these children require cognitive rehabilitation. Through the use of cutting-edge therapy and cognitive empowerment methods, some cognitive skills in children with ASD can be strengthened by digital game-based tools. This study’s main purpose is to provide a systematic review and qualitative study about designing digital games for cognitive enhancement in autistic children and to determine the main design components of such digital games. The primary focus of this study is to explore the citations in which the technical and functional elements are provided thoroughly. Furthermore, a conceptual framework is elaborated for designing a digital game for autism. A thorough review of the literature was conducted in the databases of Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, and IEEE Xplore for English publications published before January 23, 2023. Of 976 papers, 34 studies were found to be eligible in this systematic review. The bulk of the studies were carried out in Asia and Europe. Three (8.8%) studies used games that were built to be multilingual, while 22 (64.7%) studies used games that were only created in English. Creating motivation through narratives, providing incentive systems, raising the complexity level, targeting main skills, and adjusting the choices are the principal components of digital game design. (1) Main cognitive rehabilitation domains in ASD; (2) game designing details: platforms and game genres, motivations, evaluations, game graphics designs, aesthetic mechanisms, incentive systems, and famous game development engines; and (3) mutual interaction between child, therapist, and parents are the crucial categories that are described to devise a conceptual framework in this qualitative study. Of the total number of included studies, 25 studies reported positive effects on autism cases, and in nine, there has not been any evaluation of real cases; however, only usability tests have been conducted. Children with autism may benefit from using appropriate digital game-based interventions to improve mental indices. According to a review, it can be stated that the suitable computerized and digital game-based solutions could enhance cognitive outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder. However, more research is required to ascertain the true efficacy of these new technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Rezayi","given":"Sorayya"},{"family":"Shahmoradi","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Tehrani-Doost","given":"Mehdi"}],"citation-key":"rezayi2025","container-title":"Cognitive Computation","container-title-short":"Cogn Comput","DOI":"10.1007/s12559-024-10395-w","ISSN":"1866-9964","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,31]]},"language":"en","page":"60","source":"Springer Link","title":"Systematic Review and Thematic Analysis of Digital Games for Cognitive Enhancement in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Toward a Conceptual Framework","title-short":"Systematic Review and Thematic Analysis of Digital Games for Cognitive Enhancement in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12559-024-10395-w","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"rippon2024","abstract":"Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, behaviourally identified, which is generally characterised by social communication differences, and restrictive and repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests. It has long been claimed that it is more common in males. This observed preponderance of males in autistic populations has served as a focussing framework in all spheres of autism-related issues, from recognition and diagnosis through to theoretical models and research agendas. One related issue is the near total absence of females in key research areas. For example, this paper reports a review of over 120 brain-imaging studies of social brain processes in autism that reveals that nearly 70% only included male participants or minimal numbers (just one or two) of females. Authors of such studies very rarely report that their cohorts are virtually female-free and discuss their findings as though applicable to all autistic individuals. The absence of females can be linked to exclusionary consequences of autism diagnostic procedures, which have mainly been developed on male-only cohorts. There is clear evidence that disproportionately large numbers of females do not meet diagnostic criteria and are then excluded from ongoing autism research. Another issue is a long-standing assumption that the female autism phenotype is broadly equivalent to that of the male autism phenotype. Thus, models derived from male-based studies could be applicable to females. However, it is now emerging that certain patterns of social behaviour may be very different in females. This includes a specific type of social behaviour called camouflaging or masking, linked to attempts to disguise autistic characteristics. With respect to research in the field of sex/gender cognitive neuroscience, there is emerging evidence of female differences in patterns of connectivity and/or activation in the social brain that are at odds with those reported in previous, male-only studies. Decades of research have excluded or overlooked females on the autistic spectrum, resulting in the construction of inaccurate and misleading cognitive neuroscience models, and missed opportunities to explore the brain bases of this highly complex condition. A note of warning needs to be sounded about inferences drawn from past research, but if future research addresses this problem of male bias, then a deeper understanding of autism as a whole, as well as in previously overlooked females, will start to emerge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Rippon","given":"Gina"}],"citation-key":"rippon2024","container-title":"Biology of Sex Differences","container-title-short":"Biology of Sex Differences","DOI":"10.1186/s13293-024-00621-3","ISSN":"2042-6410","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,13]]},"page":"49","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Differently different?: A commentary on the emerging social cognitive neuroscience of female autism","title-short":"Differently different?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-024-00621-3","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"robles2022","abstract":"Autism - also known as Autism Spectrum Disorders or Autism Spectrum Conditions - is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by repetitive behaviours and differences in communication and social interaction. As a consequence, many autistic individuals may struggle in everyday life, which sometimes manifests in depression, unemployment, or addiction. One crucial problem in patient support and treatment is the long waiting time to diagnosis, which was approximated to seven months on average. Yet, the earlier an intervention can take place the better the patient can be supported, which was identified as a crucial factor. We propose a system to support the screening of Autism Spectrum Disorders based on a virtual reality social interaction, namely a shopping experience, with an embodied agent. During this everyday interaction, behavioral responses are tracked and recorded. We analyze this behavior with machine learning approaches to classify participants from an autistic participant sample in comparison to a typically developed individuals control sample with high accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. We believe that such tools can strongly impact the way mental disorders are assessed and may help to further find objective criteria and categorization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Robles","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Namdarian","given":"Negar"},{"family":"Otto","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Wassiljew","given":"Evelyn"},{"family":"Navab","given":"Nassir"},{"family":"Falter-Wagner","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Roth","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"robles2022","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","DOI":"10.1109/TVCG.2022.3150489","ISSN":"1941-0506","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"page":"2168-2178","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Virtual Reality Based System for the Screening and Classification of Autism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9714809","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"rynkiewicz2016","abstract":"Background: Autism spectrum conditions (autism) are diagnosed more frequently in boys than in girls. Females with autism may have been under-identified due to not only a male-biased understanding of autism but also females’ camouflaging. The study describes a new technique that allows automated coding of non-verbal mode of communication (gestures) and offers the possibility of objective, evaluation of gestures, independent of human judgment. The EyesWeb software platform and the Kinect sensor during two demonstration activities of ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition) were used.\nMethods: The study group consisted of 33 high-functioning Polish girls and boys with formal diagnosis of autism or Asperger syndrome aged 5–10, with fluent speech, IQ average and above and their parents (girls with autism, n = 16; boys with autism, n = 17). All children were assessed during two demonstration activities of Module 3 of ADOS-2, administered in Polish, and coded using Polish codes. Children were also assessed with Polish versions of the Eyes and Faces Tests. Parents provided information on the author-reviewed Polish research translation of SCQ (Social Communication Questionnaire, Current and Lifetime) and Polish version of AQ Child (Autism Spectrum Quotient, Child).\nResults: Girls with autism tended to use gestures more vividly as compared to boys with autism during two demonstration activities of ADOS-2. Girls with autism made significantly more mistakes than boys with autism on the Faces Test. All children with autism had high scores in AQ Child, which confirmed the presence of autistic traits in this group. The current communication skills of boys with autism reported by parents in SCQ were significantly better than those of girls with autism. However, both girls with autism and boys with autism improved in the social and communication abilities over the lifetime. The number of stereotypic behaviours in boys significantly decreased over life whereas it remained at a comparable level in girls with autism.\nConclusions: High-functioning females with autism might present better on non-verbal (gestures) mode of communication than boys with autism. It may camouflage other diagnostic features. It poses risk of under-diagnosis or not receiving the appropriate diagnosis for this population. Further research is required to examine this phenomenon so appropriate gender revisions to the diagnostic assessments might be implemented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Rynkiewicz","given":"Agnieszka"},{"family":"Schuller","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Marchi","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Piana","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Camurri","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Lassalle","given":"Amandine"},{"family":"Baron-Cohen","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"rynkiewicz2016","container-title":"Molecular Autism","container-title-short":"Molecular Autism","DOI":"10.1186/s13229-016-0073-0","ISSN":"2040-2392","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An investigation of the ‘female camouflage effect’ in autism using a computerized ADOS-2 and a test of sex/gender differences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.molecularautism.com/content/7/1/10","volume":"7"},

These lifelong conditions lead to social and communication impairments, and cognitive deficits. In recent years, the importance of biological sex as a vital factor determining behavioural and cognitive vulnerability has been substantiated with a direct impact on both diagnosis and therapeutic response. Several theories have been raised as an attempt to explain psychiatric sex bias. These include the extreme male brain theory, female protective effect, maternal stress, and perinatal inflammation. Here, we address this issue in the context of three important neurodevelopmental disorders where male bias exists into variable extents: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Sex differences in behaviour and brain organization are reviewed both for patient and animal research, in the context of molecular theories that may explain differential disease vulnerability. Accumulating evidence suggests a complex mechanistic scenario, with genetic predisposition and endocrine and environmental factors as interacting components governing disease onset, progression, and severity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Santos","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Martins","given":"João"},{"family":"Gonçalves","given":"Joana"},{"family":"Castelo-Branco","given":"Miguel"}],"citation-key":"santos2022","container-title":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","container-title-short":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2022.104577","ISSN":"0149-7634","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"page":"104577","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Male sex bias in early and late onset neurodevelopmental disorders: Shared aspects and differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit/hyperactivity Disorder, and Schizophrenia","title-short":"Male sex bias in early and late onset neurodevelopmental disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763422000665","volume":"135"},

  {"id":"shahamiri2020","abstract":"Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition normally linked with substantial healthcare costs and timeconsuming assessments where early detection of ASD traits can help limit the development of the condition. The existing conventional ASD screening methods contain a large number of items and are based on domain expert rules which may be criticized of being lengthy and subjective. More importantly, these methods use basic scoring functions to pinpoint to autistic traits rather intelligently learning patterns from cases and controls which can be more accurate and efficient. One promising solution to deal with the above issues and speed up ASD assessment referrals is to develop intelligent artificial intelligence screening methods that not only provide accurate pre-diagnostic classifications but also improve the efficiency and accessibility of the screening process. This paper proposes a new autism screening system that replaces the conventional scoring functions in classic screening methods with deep learning algorithms. The system is composed of a mobile application that provides the user interface capturing questionnaire data; an intelligent ASD detection web service that interfaces with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with historical ASD cases; and a database that enables the CNN to learn new knowledge from future users of the system. The CNN classification method was evaluated against a large autism dataset consisting of adult, adolescent, child, and toddler cases and controls. The results obtained from the CNN were compared with other intelligent algorithms in which superior performance was achieved by the CNN. Particularly, the proposed CNN-based ASD classification system revealed higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when compared with conventional screening methods. This indeed will be of high benefit for busy medical clinics and diagnosticians and could possibly be a new direction to change the way ASD diagnosis process is conducted in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shahamiri","given":"Seyed Reza"},{"family":"Thabtah","given":"Fadi"}],"citation-key":"shahamiri2020","container-title":"Cognitive Computation","container-title-short":"Cogn Comput","DOI":"10.1007/s12559-020-09743-3","ISSN":"1866-9956, 1866-9964","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","page":"766-777","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Autism AI: a New Autism Screening System Based on Artificial Intelligence","title-short":"Autism AI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12559-020-09743-3","volume":"12"},

As per the World Health Organization's 2022 assessment report, there was a steep increase of 25 % in MDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early diagnosis of MDs can significantly improve treatment outcome and save disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In recent times, the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)) has shown promising results in the diagnosis of MDs, and the field has witnessed a huge research output in the form of research publications. Therefore, a bibliometric mapping along with a review of recent advancements is required.\nMETHODS: This study presents a bibliometric analysis and review of the research, published over the last 10 years. Literature searches were conducted in the Scopus database for the period from January 1, 2012, to June 9, 2023. The data was filtered and screened to include only relevant and reliable publications. A total of 2811 journal articles were found. The data was exported to a comma-separated value (CSV) format for further analysis. Furthermore, a review of 40 selected studies was performed.\nRESULTS: The popularity of ML techniques in diagnosing MDs has been growing, with an annual research growth rate of 17.05 %. The Journal of Affective Disorders published the most documents (n = 97), while Wang Y. (n = 64) has published the most articles. Lotka's law is observed, with a minority of authors contributing the majority of publications. The top affiliating institutes are the West China Hospital of Sichuan University followed by the University of California, with China and the US dominating the top 10 institutes. While China has more publications, papers affiliated with the US receive more citations. Depression and schizophrenia are the primary focuses of ML and deep learning (DL) in mental disease detection. Co-occurrence network analysis reveals that ML is associated with depression, schizophrenia, autism, anxiety, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and PTSD. Popular algorithms include support vector machine (SVM) classifier, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier. Furthermore, DL is linked to neuroimaging techniques such as MRI, fMRI, and EEG, as well as bipolar disorder.

In the last two decades, to improve the accuracy and reliability of autism detection, many clinicians and researchers began to develop new screening methods by means of advanced technology like machine learning (ML). These methods include artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), a priori algorithms, and decision trees (DT). Mostly, these methods have been applied to pre-existing datasets, derived from the standard diagnostic and assessment tools, to implement and test predictive models. On the other hand, the detection of new objective behavioral measures such as biomarkers could lead to a significant strengthening of existing screening tools. In the present study, we carried out a critical review of the literature about the latest findings in this field. The aim was to shed light about the effectiveness of using ML systems for motion analysis to enhance both clinical assessment and diagnostic processes. Specifically, we discussed the contribution of ML systems in promoting early diagnosis of ASD. The literature review showed that motion patterns ML analysis predicts ASD classification as accurately as that of classical gold standard tools. However, the application of these methods is still challenging, as discussed in this review.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Simeoli","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Rega","given":"Angelo"},{"family":"Cerasuolo","given":"Mariangela"},{"family":"Nappo","given":"Raffaele"},{"family":"Marocco","given":"Davide"}],"citation-key":"simeoli2024","container-title":"Review Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders","container-title-short":"Rev J Autism Dev Disord","DOI":"10.1007/s40489-024-00435-4","ISSN":"2195-7177, 2195-7185","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using Machine Learning for Motion Analysis to Early Detect Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review","title-short":"Using Machine Learning for Motion Analysis to Early Detect Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40489-024-00435-4"},
  {"id":"singhi2023","abstract":"Autism is a spectrum disorder marked by considerable heterogeneity and characterized by impairments in the social communication domain along with the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors or interests. Comprehensive autism evaluation generally consists of assessments by a multidisciplinary team. Having multiple specialists in the evaluation team aids in diagnosis and in chalking out a comprehensive management plan. Diagnosis is generally based on detailed developmental history, clinical judgment, and the use of standardized diagnostic instruments. Differential diagnosis is complicated as many of the mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions that routinely coexist with autism also have some symptoms that overlap with autism. Several barriers are linked to delay in diagnosis including lack of comfort in diagnosing autism by primary care providers, delayed referrals, the inability of parents to raise critical developmental concerns, confusion of autism with other conditions, and health system that is not responsive to the needs of the underserved communities. The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex and still not completely understood; it involves genetics, neurobiology, and environmental exposures, leading to a diverse presentation of behaviors and symptoms. There is an imperative need to start therapeutic interventions as soon as a diagnosis of autism is suspected rather than wait for a definitive diagnosis. Early diagnosis is vital as timely intervention can lead to better outcomes for children and their families.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Singhi","given":"Pratibha"},{"family":"Malhi","given":"Prahbhjot"}],"citation-key":"singhi2023","container-title":"Indian Journal of Pediatrics","container-title-short":"Indian J Pediatr","DOI":"10.1007/s12098-022-04363-1","ISSN":"0019-5456, 0973-7693","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"364-368","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder: What the Pediatricians Should Know","title-short":"Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12098-022-04363-1","volume":"90"},

  {"id":"stanciu2016","abstract":"Résumé\nLes anomalies sensorielles sont désormais reconnues comme des symptômes-clés dans les troubles du spectre autistique (TSA), et sont reprises pour la première fois dans les critères diagnostiques internationaux du DSM-5. Leur importance clinique est illustrée par les témoignages des parents et des personnes présentant un TSA, ainsi que par les nombreuses études qui se sont intéressées au cours des dernières années à cette question sous différents angles. Plusieurs modèles explicatifs de l’autisme se sont développés à partir des atypies de la perception sensorielle relevées dans les TSA. Dans cet article, nous parcourons les données épidémiologiques, cliniques et neurophysiologiques sur ce sujet dans le but de donner une image d’ensemble des connaissances actuelles. Nous relevons la grande variabilité qui caractérise ces symptômes, tant d’un individu à l’autre qu’au fil du temps. Les mécanismes physiologiques et biologiques sous-jacents n’en sont pas encore élucidés. Dans un deuxième temps, nous discutons l’articulation de ces données avec les principaux modèles explicatifs des TSA basés sur la perception. Certains de ces modèles nous paraissent prometteurs : ils prennent en compte la complexité et la variabilité des présentations cliniques des TSA tout en proposant des hypothèses concernant les processus neurobiologiques sous-jacents. Enfin, nous abordons les pistes d’explorations futures, notamment avec la recherche translationnelle.\nBackground\nSince the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders: DSM-5, sensory processing anomalies have for the first time been identified as diagnostic criteria in the international classification and thus been recognized as part of the core symptoms in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Their clinical relevance and their critical importance for the patients is underlined by numerous first-person accounts, and many recent studies have investigated their epidemiology as well as their behavioral and neurophysiological links with the other core symptoms of ASDs. In the past years, several explanatory models of autism have been developed in relation with the atypical sensory processing features found in these disorders.\nMethods\nIn this article, we summarize the research data about sensory anomalies in ASDs with regard to epidemiology, clinical presentations, and neurophysiology. We then summarize the latest explanatory theories based on perception in autism, and discuss the implications of the recent data in relation with them, as well as the latest research directions.\nFindings\nSensory anomalies in ASDs are characterized by the variability of their presentation and of their clinical impact, not only between individuals but also in time. At present the underlying physiological mechanisms and their relation with the other core symptoms in autism are not fully understood, but much progress has been made in the last years, as research focus on these anomalies has been increasing. Several models show interesting perspectives for explaining atypical sensory processing as well as other core symptoms in ASDs. Some could account for the complexity and clinical features variability of the autism spectrum, as well as provide indications for underlying neurological processes and even treatment possibilities.\nPerspective\nMore research is needed in order to verify the validity of these models and hopefully to unify the perception of the underlying mechanisms leading to ASDs. Translational approaches are especially of a great interest, as we will need to understand the links between the behavioral clinical aspects, the neurological functioning, the molecular processes and the genetical substratum. But it will also be necessary to continue reflecting on the very definition of what we call ASDs with every new step in our knowledge about these complex disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Stanciu","given":"R."},{"family":"Delvenne","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"stanciu2016","container-title":"Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence","container-title-short":"Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence","DOI":"10.1016/j.neurenf.2016.02.002","ISSN":"0222-9617","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,1]]},"page":"155-162","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Traitement de l’information sensorielle dans les troubles du spectre autistique","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0222961716000131","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"unwin2023","abstract":"Autistic people experience the sensory world differently, impacting behavior. First-hand accounts and group-based research have found that sensory differences impact a range of things including family life, anxiety, participation, and daily living. Early sensory differences are widely reported to be associated with a cascade of developmental difference, suggesting that early autism diagnosis and sensory mapping could enable the provision of supports to facilitate flourishing. However, appropriate measurement tools are not available as all rely on proxy report or are observation measures which include limited modalities or domains and require the administration of stimuli. Therefore, following the gold-standard recommendations for measurement development outlined by the PROMIS® framework, we created the Sensory Observation Autism Rating scale (SOAR). We identified sensory behaviors across all primary domains and modalities through an extensive autism-sensory literature review and from focus groups with autism stakeholders. The initial item bank was then refined by an expert panel and through video coding five-minutes of free play from Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule assessments of 105 age- and gender-matched autistic and developmentally delayed children (aged 13–36 months; 38 female). An additional 25% of the sample were double coded to investigate interrater reliability. Observational data and expert review supported the reduction of the item bank to 37 items. We propose that the refined SOAR has excellent face and ecological validity, along with interrater reliability (Intraclass correlation = 0.87–0.99). Following further data collection and refinement, SOAR has promise to fully characterize sensory behaviors in autistic children and indicate useful supports.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Unwin","given":"Katy L."},{"family":"Barbaro","given":"Josephine"},{"family":"Uljarevic","given":"Mirko"},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Azul"},{"family":"Chetcuti","given":"Madison"},{"family":"Lane","given":"Alison.

Recognizing and handling it timely may reduce the risk and improve the condition when compared to the prior. To do such diagnosis, the current assessment can be too expensive which leads to the requirement of Deep learning models to be integrated with neuroimaging bio-inspired methods.

Particle Swarm is a bio-inspired technique which is metaheuristic by nature, applied for feature selection. The relative analysis based on evaluation of this proposed model is carried out further with various machine learning models using the classification metrics.

  {"id":"walsh2021","abstract":"Females with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been long overlooked in neuroscience research, but emerging evidence suggests they show distinct phenotypic trajectories and age-related brain differences. Sex-related biological factors (e.g., hormones, genes) may play a role in ASD etiology and have been shown to influence neurodevelopmental trajectories. Thus, a lifespan approach is warranted to understand brain-based sex differences in ASD. This systematic review on MRI-based sex differences in ASD was conducted to elucidate variations across the lifespan and inform biomarker discovery of ASD in females We identified articles through two database searches. Fifty studies met criteria and underwent integrative review. We found that regions expressing replicable sex-by-diagnosis differences across studies overlapped with regions showing sex differences in neurotypical cohorts. Furthermore, studies investigating age-related brain differences across a broad age-span suggest distinct neurodevelopmental patterns in females with ASD. Qualitative comparison across youth and adult studies also supported this hypothesis. However, many studies collapsed across age, which may mask differences. Furthermore, accumulating evidence supports the female protective effect in ASD, although only one study examined brain circuits implicated in \"protection.\" When synthesized with the broader literature, brain-based sex differences in ASD may come from various sources, including genetic and endocrine processes involved in brain \"masculinization\" and \"feminization\" across early development, puberty, and other lifespan windows of hormonal transition. Furthermore, sex-related biology may interact with peripheral processes, in particular the stress axis and brain arousal system, to produce distinct neurodevelopmental patterns in males and females with ASD. Future research on neuroimaging-based sex differences in ASD would benefit from a lifespan approach in well-controlled and multivariate studies.

Eye-movement data were collected from the participants watching videos that featured eye-tracking paradigms for assessing social and non-social cognition. Five machine learning algorithms, namely random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, artificial neural network, and extreme gradient boosting, were trained to classify children with ASD and TD. The best-performing algorithm was selected to build the final model which was further evaluated in a prospective cohort of 80 children. The Shapley values interpreted important eye-tracking features.\nResults\nRandom forest outperformed other algorithms during model development and achieved an area under the curve of 0.849 (< 3 years: 0.832, ≥ 3 years: 0.868) on the external validation set. Of the ten most important eye-tracking features, three measured social cognition, and the rest were related to non-social cognition. A deterioration in model performance was observed using only the social or non-social cognition-related eye-tracking features.\nLimitations\nThe sample size of this study, although larger than that of existing studies of ASD based on eye-tracking data, was still relatively small compared to the number of features.\nConclusions\nMachine learning models based on eye-tracking data have the potential to be cost- and time-efficient digital tools for the early identification of ASD. Eye-tracking phenotypes related to social and non-social cognition play an important role in distinguishing children with ASD from TD children.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Qiuhong"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Wenxin"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Dongchuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yuanjie"},{"family":"Long","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Haiyi"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Ximing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Tingyu"}],"citation-key":"wei2024","container-title":"Journal of Affective Disorders","container-title-short":"Journal of Affective Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.jad.2024.04.049","ISSN":"0165-0327","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,1]]},"page":"326-334","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Early identification of autism spectrum disorder based on machine learning with eye-tracking data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032724006554","volume":"358"},
  {"id":"williams2021","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with functional brain alterations that underlie the expression of behaviour. Males are diagnosed up to four times more than females, and sex differences have been identified in memory, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, and social communication. Unfortunately, there exists a lack of information on the sex-dependent mechanisms of ASD, as well as biological markers to distinguish sex-specific symptoms in ASD. This can often result in a standardized diagnosis for individuals across the spectrum, despite significant differences in the various ASD subtypes. Alterations in neuronal connectivity and oscillatory activity, such as is observed in ASD, are highly coupled to behavioural states. Yet, despite the well-identified sexual dimorphisms that exist in ASD, these functional patterns have rarely been analyzed in the context of sex differences or symptomology. This review summarizes alterations in neuronal oscillatory function in ASD, discusses the age, region, symptom and sex-specific differences that are currently observed across the spectrum, and potential targets for regulating neuronal oscillatory activity in ASD. The need to identify sex-specific biomarkers, in order to facilitate specific diagnostic criteria and allow for more targeted therapeutic approaches for ASD will also be discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Olivia O.

  {"id":"young2018","abstract":"Background\nAutism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with various clinical presentations. It has been historically considered a male disorder. An increasing number of authors stress the existence of sex/gender bias in prevalence and the need to define sex/gender differences in the clinical presentation.\nReview\nRecently, an increasing number of authors have studied the impact of sex/gender on autism's clinical presentation. The sex ratio of four boys to one girl commonly reported in literature is questioned. Sociocultural and familial influences can impact female clinical presentation as well as the way the difficulties of girls with autism are perceived. Issues of autism diagnostic instruments such as sex/gender bias are also studied since they have an impact on the access to diagnosis for girls. Clinical variability is a part of autism spectrum disorder, but some traits appear to be more specific of the female phenotype: existence of a “camouflage” phenomenon and less unusual play or restricted interests.\nDiscussion\nBetter understanding and diagnosis of females with autism is required to ensure the access to the support and treatment they need. Professionals must apprehend the sex/gender clinical differences to prevent the frequent misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis of females with autism.\nConclusion\nPursuing research on sex/gender differences seems necessary to ensure appropriate support and diagnosis of undiagnosed females.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"H."},{"family":"Oreve","given":"M. -J."},{"family":"Speranza","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"young2018","container-title":"Archives de Pédiatrie","container-title-short":"Archives de Pédiatrie","DOI":"10.1016/j.arcped.2018.06.008","ISSN":"0929-693X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"399-403","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Clinical characteristics and problems diagnosing autism spectrum disorder in girls","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X18301477","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"young2021","abstract":"The image of the non-verbal child, flapping and spinning, totally absorbed in their own obsessive interests, as described by Kanner (Nerv Child 2:217–250, 1943), represents the more traditional view of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the stereotypical behaviors that accompany this condition. However, with the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1994 (4th edition; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th edn. Washington, DC: Author, 1994), the spectrum was expanded to include persons with a milder variant of the disorder (i.e. Asperger’s syndrome). With this came a broader interpretation of the presentation of these restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests (RRBI) in the current edition of the DSM, the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 5th edn. Washington, DC: Author, 2013). As a result, the DSM-5 now includes heterogenic behaviors such as motor stereotypies, sensory-related behaviors, circumscribed interests, rituals, excessive sensitivity to change, and echolalic speech. While it is agreed that these behaviors are pervasive in this condition, and form part of the ASD diagnostic criteria, there remains a lack of consensus regarding a definition of RRBI (Leekam et al. Psychol Bull 137:562–593, 2011) and how pervasive these behaviors must be to be considered deviant and of diagnostic significance. This, therefore, creates challenges for researchers and clinicians in designing valid and reliable assessments of RRBI that are sensitive to this disorder, yet specific to ASD. The purpose of this chapter is to operationalize these behaviors and review the currently available tools so that we may determine whether these tools are valid measures of these behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"Robyn L."},{"family":"Lim","given":"Alliyza"}],"citation-key":"young2021","container-title":"Repetitive and Restricted Behaviors and Interests in Autism Spectrum Disorders: From Neurobiology to Behavior","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-66445-9_8","editor":[{"family":"Gal","given":"Eynat"},{"family":"Yirmiya","given":"Nurit"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-66445-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"115-142","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Measurement of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors in Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-66445-9_8"},
  {"id":"zeidan2022","abstract":"Prevalence estimates of autism are essential for informing public policy, raising awareness, and developing research priorities. Using a systematic review, we synthesized estimates of the prevalence of autism worldwide. We examined factors accounting for variability in estimates and critically reviewed evidence relevant for hypotheses about biological or social determinants (viz., biological sex, sociodemographic status, ethnicity/race, and nativity) potentially modifying prevalence estimates of autism. We performed the search in November 2021 within Medline for studies estimating autism prevalence, published since our last systematic review in 2012. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Since 2012, 99 estimates from 71 studies were published indicating a global autism prevalence that ranges within and across regions, with a median prevalence of 100/10,000 (range: 1.09/10,000 to 436.0/10,000). The median male-to-female ratio was 4.2. The median percentage of autism cases with co-occurring intellectual disability was 33.0%. Estimates varied, likely reflecting complex and dynamic interactions between patterns of community awareness, service capacity, help seeking, and sociodemographic factors. A limitation of this review is that synthesizing methodological features precludes a quality appraisal of studies. Our findings reveal an increase in measured autism prevalence globally, reflecting the combined effects of multiple factors including the increase in community awareness and public health response globally, progress in case identification and definition, and an increase in community capacity. Hypotheses linking factors that increase the likelihood of developing autism with variations in prevalence will require research with large, representative samples and comparable autism diagnostic criteria and case-finding methods in diverse world regions over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeidan","given":"Jinan"},{"family":"Fombonne","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Scorah","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Alaa"},{"family":"Durkin","given":"Maureen S."},{"family":"Saxena","given":"Shekhar"},{"family":"Yusuf","given":"Afiqah"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Elsabbagh","given":"Mayada"}],"citation-key":"zeidan2022","container-title":"Autism Research","container-title-short":"Autism Research","DOI":"10.1002/aur.2696","ISSN":"1939-3792, 1939-3806","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"en","page":"778-790","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Global prevalence of autism: A systematic review update","title-short":"Global prevalence of autism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aur.2696","volume":"15"},

Abnormal visual perception is one of the typical symptoms of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). They urgently need early diagnosis and regular assessment to develop appropriate intervention strategies. However, there is a serious contradiction between the rapidly increasing demand for assessment and the limited supply of professional assessment. As a convenient and effective supplement, computer-aided methods have become the development trend of ASD assessment. This article analyzed the assessment elements of visual perception, including visual memory, visual search, visual discrimination, and visual overall processing. Then the corresponding computer games were designed and implemented, and the children's visual perception ability was assessed through game score, game duration, and scoring rate indicator calculated by them. Through comparative experiments between ASD children and typical developing (TD) children, data analysis results showed that there were significant differences between ASD children and TD children in terms of visual memory, visual search, visual discrimination, and overall processing, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed computer games for visual perception assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jingying"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaodi"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xianke"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guangshuai"}],"citation-key":"zhang2021","container-title":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology & Education (TALE)","DOI":"10.1109/TALE52509.2021.9678668","event-title":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology & Education (TALE)","ISSN":"2470-6698","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"page":"01-06","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Application of Computer Games in the Visual Perception Assessment of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9678668"},
